					<description><![CDATA[This lady need to understand that still a little girl. She has a lot of things to focus on in life rather than boy friend. Boy friend at this early stage of her life is a big distraction to her brighter future.
She don’t a responsible Aunty. Anybody that makes her feel dejected for not having a boyfriend is irresponsible. A young lady that have a bright future should be directed aright by every reasonable human being.
More importantly and in a more serious note; this young lady should make friend with Jesus. This is expedient and paramount in her life first. By so doing she’ll become more responsible and valued by young men.
Thank.]]></description>
