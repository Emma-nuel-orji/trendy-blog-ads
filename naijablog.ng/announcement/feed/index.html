<p>…as govt upgrades the media outfit to meet international standards</p>



<p>The Godwin Obaseki-led government has said there are no plans to lay off the staff of the state-owned newspaper, the Nigerian Observer, clearly pointing out that the state media outfit is being upgraded to conform with New media practices.</p>



<p>The governor made this known during a tour of the ongoing revamp of the media outfit in Benin City, the Edo State capital.</p>



<p>Obaseki stated &#8221; nobody will be laid off,” noting that those who cannot be retrained in digital media will be redeployed to other ministries of government.</p>



<p>“I am sure that there are other duties they can perform in the Ministry of Communication and Orientation, as well as other ministries and agencies of government,” he added.</p>



<p>The governor further stated “They are actually printing online. As far as I am concerned, the Nigerian Observer is alive. You may not see the old building but it is running. As a government, what we are trying to do is to revive the media, culture and sports sectors because these are the new economy.</p>



<p>“We are taking advantage of the history of this premises to rebuild the press that was here before. We replaced the 50 years old press building with a modern and digital web press.</p>



<p>“Not just to print only the Observer, we expect that it would serve the whole of the sub-region. We also have a speed master to do digital printing. You can&#8217;t have the media without a print. So, this is the print aspect of the ecosystem that we are creating.”</p>



<p>The governor continued: “We have taken the old Nigerian Observer press and we have built it into a world-class sound stage for film and music. The sound stage is being prepared for the Edo film festival which will take place in August.</p>



<p>“We are equipping the studio so that our young people who are into the production of music and movies and don&#8217;t have the money to invest in this kind of high-end equipment can always come here to do so. That is where we can energize the already active creative spirit in our young people, particularly in music and movies.”</p>

<p>Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC has reveal that 209 machine for continuous voters registration has been deployed.</p>



<p>INEC made this known in a press statement sign by  Barr. Festus Okoye<br>Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee on Friday 10th June 2022.</p>



<p>According to the statement titled </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">ONGOING CONTINUOUS VOTER REGISTRATION (CVR) EXERCISE</h2>



<p>Read:</p>



<p>The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has received reports from our States indicating an unprecedented surge in the number of citizens that wish to register as voters and the challenges they face across the country. In some States, the sudden turnout of prospective registrants is overwhelming.</p>



<p>Consequently, the Commission convened an urgent meeting with all the Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) yesterday Thursday 9th June 2022 to review the situation so that eligible Nigerians who wish to register are able to do so. The necessity to urgently deploy more voter enrolment machines to ease the congestion at the registration centres was identified as a priority.</p>



<p>In response, the Commission has immediately released additional 209 machines deployed mainly to the five South Eastern States, Lagos and Kano where the pressure is most acute.</p>



<p>The Commission will monitor the situation over the next few days. Thereafter, it will meet to review the progress of the exercise.</p>



<p>Every step will be taken and all options will be explored to ensure that eligible Nigerians are given the opportunity to register as voters.</p>



<p>The Commission appeals for patience and understanding of all citizens. Every Nigerian who is 18 years of age and above has the constitutional right to register and vote in any part of the country he/she resides without let or hinderance.</p>



<p>The sudden surge is an affirmation of the increasing confidence Nigerians have in our electoral process. The Commission will continue to ensure that this confidence is sustained.</p>

<p>For the first time in many years, I will not be attending the PDP Convention. I will watch from my house though I am a member of the Electoral Sub-Committee for the Convention.</p>



<p>On May 10th a National Delegate Congress Committee chaired by Prof Kingsley Chimsorom Chilaka of Nnamdi Azikiwe University went to Anambra to conduct the congress and did not conduct any congress in Idemili North LGA where I had bought form to contest as a National Delegate.</p>



<p>Strangely the committee submitted a report and fake result for Idemili North LGA with the name of someone that did not purchase the form for the congress. It is time we look into the role of Academics in the corruption in our electoral process. I will follow up on that soon.</p>



<p>INEC&#8217;s report clearly stated that they did not observe any election in Idemili North LGA as they were at the venue till 7 pm. I submitted a petition to the Party with a certified copy of the INEC report. I requested the Party to reschedule and conduct the congress in line with the party rules and Electoral Act.</p>



<p>I waited till yesterday Friday 27th May for the Party NWC to sit on the petition to no avail instead the Party went ahead and published the name from the fake result as National Delegate.</p>



<p>As a loyal Party member who have remained a dedicated and prominent voice of the Party since the Party went into opposition, I have elected to stay away from the convention and will not pursue a legal redress against the party that I have given so much at grave personal risk and cost.</p>



<p>I wish the Party a successful convention.</p>

<p>The attention of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has been drawn to speculations from some strange quarters that it has postponed its 2022 National Convention holding today, Saturday, May 28, 2022</p>



<p>For the avoidance of doubt, the PDP states in very clear terms that is has not postponed its 2022 Special National Convention. The 2022 Special National Convention of the PDP is on course as scheduled today, Saturday May 28, 2022 and there is no contemplation whatsoever for postponement.</p>



<p>The PDP as a party of due process has since commenced processes to elect our Presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections in line with our mission to rescue and rebuild our nation from misrule.</p>



<p>Our Party remains focused and will not be distracted by the shenanigans and underhand dealings of the rudderless, deceitful and manipulative All Progressives Congress (APC), which is desperate to orchestrate uncertainties, derail the electoral process and subvert the Will of the people in the 2023 general elections.</p>



<p>The PDP 2022 Special National Convention is already on course, our Presidential candidates, national delegates, teeming members of our great Party and Nigerians from across the country are set for the National Convention, which will at the end, credibly and transparently deliver a Presidential candidate who will be the choice of majority of Nigerians in the 2023 general elections.</p>



<p>The PDP therefore charges our members, swarming supporters, the International Community, election monitors and the general public to disregard and completely discountenance suggestions that the 2022 Special National Convention has been postponed.</p>



<p>Signed:</p>



<p>Hon. Debo Ologunagba<br />National Publicity Secretary</p>
