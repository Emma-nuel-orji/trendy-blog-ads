<p>-Declares a final dividend of 60kobo per share</p>



<p>Lagos, Nigeria, April 16, 2024: Leading financial institution, Fidelity Bank Plc, has released its 2023 full year Audited Financial Statements, reporting a 131.5% growth in Profit Before Tax to N 124,26 billion.</p>



<p>According to the results, which was issued to the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) today, the bank grew Gross Earnings by 64.9% YoY to N555.83 billion, driven by 81.6% growth in Net interest income which increased from N152.7billion to N277.37 billion. This led to a Profit After Tax of N99.45 billion representing a 112.9% annual growth.</p>



<p>Commenting on the Bank’s commendable performance, Dr. Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe,OON, MD/CEO of Fidelity Bank Plc said, “We closed the financial year with strong double-digit growth across key income and balance-sheet lines. Our performance in 2023 is an attestation of our capacity to deliver superior returns to shareholders despite the difficulties in our operating environment. Profit before tax grew by 131.5% to N124.3bn from N53.7bn in 2022FY, leading to an increase in Return on Average Equity (RoAE) of 26.5% from 15.6% in 2022FY.”</p>



<p>A review of the financial performance showed that the bank grew Net interest income by 81.6% to N277.4bn driven by a 55.5% increase in interest income, thus reflecting a steady rise in asset yield throughout the year. The average funding cost dropped by 20bps to 4.4% due to increased low-cost funds that grew from 83.6% in 2022FY to 97.4% in 2023. The combination of higher asset yield and lower funding cost led to an increase in Net Interest Margin (NIM) of 8.1% from 6.3% in 2022FY.</p>



<p>Similarly, Total Customer Deposits crossed the N4tn mark as deposits grew by 55.6% from N2.6tn in 2022FY. The increase was driven by 81.1% growth in low-cost funds.</p>



<p>Despite the challenging operating environment, the bank reaffirmed its devotion to helping individuals grow, inspiring businesses to thrive and empowering economies to prosper by increasing Net Loans &amp; Advances to N3.1tn from N2.1tn in 2022FY.</p>



<p>Despite the growth in its loan portfolio, Regulatory Ratios were maintained well above the required thresholds, with liquidity ratio at 45.3% from 39.6% in 2022FY and capital adequacy ratio (CAR) at 16.2% compared to the minimum requirement of 15.0%.</p>



<p>“We recognize the changing dynamics in the Nigerian banking space and the need to monitor and proactively manage evolving risks. The proposed final dividend of 60 kobo per share reflects our commitment to strong value creation and returns to our shareholders,” explained Onyeali-Ikpe.</p>



<p>Fidelity Bank has consistently paid dividend since 2006. With the proposed final dividend of 60 kobo per share, Fidelity Bank would be paying investors a total dividend of 85 kobo per share for the reporting period, a 70.0% increase compared to the 50 kobo per share paid to its shareholders in the previous year.</p>



<p>Ranked as one of the best banks in Nigeria, Fidelity Bank is a full-fledged customer commercial bank with over 8.3 million customers serviced across its 251 business offices in Nigeria and the United Kingdom as well as on digital banking channels.</p>



<p>The bank has won multiple local and international awards including the Export Finance Bank of the Year at the 2023 BusinessDay Banks and Other Financial Institutions (BAFI) Awards, the Best Payment Solution Provider Nigeria 2023 and Best SME Bank Nigeria 2022 by the Global Banking and Finance Awards; Best Bank for SMEs in Nigeria by the Euromoney Awards for Excellence 2023; and Best Domestic Private Bank in Nigeria by the Euromoney Global Private Banking Awards 2023.</p>

<p>Nigerian bodybuilder dies after being shot by his wife during a disagreement in the U.S.</p>



<p>A US-based Nigerian bodybuilder, Michael Chidozie, has died weeks after his wife shot him multiple times at their apartment in Houston, Texas.</p>



<p>The 26-year-old died last week after his wife Keaiirra Shavoiyae Chidozie, 28, shot him four times in front of their kids in their home on March 21, 2024.</p>



<p>DailyMail reports that the deceased was rushed to Ben Taub Hospital after police found him with gunshot wounds and his wife in a panic holding their two kids, aged three and two.</p>



<p>Chidozie lingered on life support as his family prayed for his recovery, but he suffered a devastating spinal injury and di£d of complications 18 days later.</p>



<p>According to the report, Keaiirra was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after the shooting, and her charges have not been upgraded since his death.</p>



<p>She claimed to have shot Chidozie in self-defense as she feared for her life during the argument when he followed her into their bedroom. It’s unclear what the argument was over.</p>



<p>The argument began elsewhere in the house before she went to the bedroom, where she picked up a pistol and shot him.</p>



<p>Chidozie was shot once in the arm, once in the chest, and twice in his torso and left to di£ on the bedroom floor.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Keaiirra was released on bail and is set to next face court on May 23. Their children are being cared for by other family.</p>

<p>Investigate Victor Osimhen To Know If He&#8217;s Using Jazz or Belongs To A Coven- Nigerian Columnist Azuka Onwuka Says</p>



<p>Nigerian Columnist, Azuka Onwuka has said that Victor Osimhen should be investigated thoroughly after the striker rose tall to score airlifting goal against Monza few days ago.</p>



<p>Onwuka wrote on his Facebook page,</p>



<p>&#8220;It has been proved repeatedly that Victor Osimhen does not use any performance-enhancing drvgs. But nobody has investigated if he belongs to any coven where members are given the power to fly.</p>



<p>If not, how can a normal human being fly like this? Even Cristiano Ronaldo does not fly this high.</p>



<p>Abeg, Osimhen needs to be thoroughly investigated to know the &#8220;jazz&#8221; or ọtụmọkpọ he is using or his rank in the coven.<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f61c.png" alt="😜" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> &#8220;</p>

<p>Nigerian comedian, basket mouth speak on how he feel when they accused wizkid of being proud.</p>



<p>In his explanation, </p>



<p>“All these talks about Wizkid being proud will always be funny to me. 2014 I had my show in Lagos and I really needed Wizkid to perform and I was willing to pay him anything.</p>



<p>I contacted him and he told not to bother about paying him. He promised to come as a surprise guest &amp; put up a show for free.</p>



<p>3 days to the event, Wizkid called me that he won’t be able to show up coz a very important family emergency had happened. I was really heartbroken but I just had to accept the reality. 35 minutes after that call, Wizkid asked me to contact any Nigerian artiste I will like to book for the event and get back to him with the bills. I quickly contacted Lil Kesh, Kcee, Yemi Alade and Phyno. The bill was about 40 Million Naira and Wizkid cleared it all. Mannn! I thought I was dreaming. Wizkid is not the guy social media keeps trying to make y’all believe he is” ~ Basket Mouth.</p>
