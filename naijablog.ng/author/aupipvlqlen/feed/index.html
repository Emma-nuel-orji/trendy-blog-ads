<p><strong>He tweeted</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This filthy, despicable, loathsome, vile animal was caught in an uncompleted building beside my house this morning sleeping with a 6 year old girl.</p>
<p>“He has since been taken to the police station and the girl has been taken to the hospital for medical examination.</p>
<p>“If not for my intervention, he wouldn’t have made it to the police station. Me sef chop beating small.<br />
The victim’s mother was distraught, the girl was brave &amp; it was her scream that alerted us.</p>
<p>“I’m very sad &amp; angry. When will these stop? We need to do better as a society.</p>
<p>“Sadly the animal succeeded and he confessed to penetrating the little girl.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In celebration of her recovery from Covid-19, a 103-year-old woman has enjoyed her favourite ice-cold beer which she hasn’t had in a while.<br />
According to CNN, the woman identified as Jennie Stejna tested positive for Coronavirus in late April.</p>
<p>Her granddaughter Shelley Gunn revealed her family had lost hope and at a point called her to say their goodbye after the medical team informed them Stejna had stopped eating and drinking and might not make it through the night</p>
<p>However, on May 8, Stejna’s nursing home, called her family to reveal that she had tested negative, and was symptom-free.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The nurses came into her room, and she said, “I’m not sick anymore, Get the hell out,” Gunn said.</p>
<p>Stejna was treated to her favourite drink, a cold beer by the nursing home staff when she finally recovered.</p>
<p>“I think it’s given everyone a smile and some hope, while it’s dark days for everybody,” Gunn said.</p></blockquote>
