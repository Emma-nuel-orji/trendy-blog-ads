<p>Dear Nigerians,</p>
<p>I know that many of you are angry, and understandably so. We could’ve moved faster and for this we are sorry.</p>
<p>I fully understand how many young people feel. Many feel that we have been too silent and have simply not done enough.<br />
These feelings of frustration are justified.</p>
<p>There are far too many people who have been brutalised at the hands of the police and this is unacceptable. We must take responsibility for protecting young people, even sometimes from those who are paid to protect them.</p>
<p>Over the past week, we have been following the protests, and I have had a number of discussions with key people in the administration that you deserve to be informed about. Transparency, after all, is a key tenet of government.</p>
<p>Several meetings have been held with: the Senate President Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, Speaker of the House Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, the Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Chairman of the Police Service Commission, the IG of the Nigerian Police (IGP), the Executive Secretary of National Human Rights Commision Nigeria, and governors.</p>
<p>We understand that you want to see action from us and I’m here to tell you that work is ongoing. I chaired a meeting of 36 state governors and the Minister of the FCT (NEC), where we resolved to set up judicial panels of inquiry so we can see justice served, and fast.</p>
<p>The reason being that only state governors, by law, can set up judicial inquiries in their states. The hearings will be public.</p>
<p>With Mr. President’s approval, SARS has been completely disestablished, and none of its former members will feature in any police tactical units.</p>
<p>I am sending my deepest condolences to the families of Jimoh Isiaq, and all those who have lost their lives at the hands of wayward police officers. To those injured, I wish a full and speedy recovery.</p>
<p>We have proposed that each state government sets up a Victims’ Support Fund, which the Nigerian Government will support. This is the least that we can do to compensate for the injustice suffered at the hands of errant officers.</p>
<p>We also understand that the issues that you’re raising are bigger than just SARS. They’re deep and systemic and we’re undertaking comprehensive measures that will revamp the police by addressing issues of welfare, service conditions and training.</p>
<p>On Monday, Mr. President also reiterated his commitment to these extensive police reforms.</p>
<p>We will continue to update and engage with you all on these action steps and the ones to come, in the spirit of transparency, so that you can hold us accountable. We are, after all, here to serve you and we owe you a duty to win back your trust.</p>
<p>Keep safe. God bless you.</p>
<p>Prof Yemi Osinbajo,SAN,<br />
Vice President,<br />
Federal Republic of Nigeria.<br />
16-10-2020.</p>

<p>Cardi B took to Instagram to share a photo of herself while reminding the world she’s now single. However, the nature of the photo led to speculations she has been initiated into the Illuminati.</p>
<p>In the photo, the rapper is seen wearing a red latex jumpsuit with a red hairband in the form of horns.</p>
<p>“Single, bad and rich. I do the controlling,” she captioned the photo.</p>

<p>People commented, claiming she was indirectly announcing her entry into the Illuminati.</p>
<p>She reacted by sharing another photo of herself in an angel costume, with diamonds covering her private parts and white wings sticking out behind her.</p>
<p>“Stop with the Illuminati shit ….It was just costumes for a tiktok video DAMN!” she captioned the photo.</p>

<div></div>
<p>Arsenal signed Thomas Partey on deadline day</p>
<div></div>
<p>Arsenal have completed the signing of Thomas Partey from Atletico Madrid.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The Ghana international completed the bulk of his medical in Madrid and arrived in London on Monday night to finalise his £45million transfer.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Gunners boss Mikel Arteta was desperate to add a dynamic central midfielder to his squad before the deadline, with Partey always the number one target.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Speaking after the signing was confirmed, Arteta told the official</p>
<p><a type="anchor"> Arsenal </a>website: &#8220;We have been watching Thomas for a while, so we’re now delighted to add such a high quality player to our squad.</p>
<div></div>
<div class="_2gr9A _1jgss">
<div class="undefined _3G4uE _237A3  undefined"><img decoding="async" id="" src="https://i0.wp.com/akcdn.bangcdn.net/res/content/2020/10/06/20201006080211_-2073075671_8075562032266791097_480_270_80_webp.webp?w=678" data-recalc-dims="1" /></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>&#8220;He is a dynamic midfielder with great energy. He brings a lot of experience from a top club that has competed at the highest level in La Liga and the Champions League for several years.</p>
<div></div>
<p>&#8220;We’re very impressed with his attitude and his approach to the game.</p>
<div></div>
<p>&#8220;He’s an intelligent footballer and we’re looking forward to him integrating into our system and contributing to the progress we’re building at the moment at the club.”</p>
<div></div>
<p>Technical director Edu added: &#8220;Thomas has all the right attributes to be a top player for Arsenal. He is a leader on and off the pitch and he is exactly the kind of player and person we want at the club.</p>
<div></div>
<p>&#8220;We already feel like we know Thomas very well based on the work we have done analysing his performances closely in recent times.</p>
<div></div>
<p>&#8220;With his all-round game and positive aggressive style, he will be a brilliant addition to our squad. We’ve made a strong start to the season and we want to continue to build on this with Thomas now part of our club.”</p>

<div></div>
<p>Some of Arsenal&#8217;s players also reacted to Partey&#8217;s arrival, with several taking to social media to show their approval.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The Arsenal Instagram account posted a picture of Partey after the deal was completed, with the caption: &#8220;Welcome to the Partey! #NoThomasNoPartey.&#8221;</p>
<div></div>
<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Hector Bellerin and Sead Kolasinac were then the first players from the current first team squad to &#8216;like&#8217; the post.</p>

</div>
<p>Jurgen Klopp admitted nobody was to blame but his Liverpool team after they &#8220;lost the plot&#8221; during their 7-2 defeat to Aston Villa on Sunday.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The reigning champions suffered the shock hammering as Villa striker Ollie Watkins helped fire the hosts into a 4-1 lead at the break.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Liverpool goalkeeper Adrian made a glaring error for the first goal, while defender Joe Gomez was hauled off after a poor display at the back.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Three of Villa&#8217;s goals came from big deflections too, but Klopp was adamant the result was down to his players doing &#8220;all the things you should not do&#8221;.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Asked why Liverpool were beaten so convincingly, Klopp told Sky Sports: &#8220;I can&#8217;t explain, I&#8217;m not sure, but I can tell you what I saw.</p>
<div></div>
<div class="_2gr9A _1jgss">
<div class="undefined _3G4uE _237A3  undefined"><img decoding="async" id="" src="https://i0.wp.com/akcdn.bangcdn.net/res/content/2020/10/04/20201004212747_-468810918_1599157880273247727_480_320_80_webp.webp?w=678" data-recalc-dims="1" /></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>&#8220;For different reasons Aston Villa forced all the mistakes we made, we played in their cards.</p>
<div></div>
<p>&#8220;Obviously with the first goal, with the second as well, the third massively, the free-kick and all these kind of things, then the game has a specific direction.</p>
<div></div>
<p>&#8220;The first goal obviously had an impact but not more than it should, Adrian made a mistake, easy goal for them but we conceded goals like this in the past. We lost obviously the plot.</p>
<div></div>
<p>&#8220;Creating in the last third was really good. As Villa won the ball each one was a counter attack so our protection was under average.</p>
<div></div>
<p>&#8220;You could see already first half, body language dropped and all these kinds of things. You&#8217;re 4-1 down, but how the game was we didn&#8217;t think we should stop playing.&#8221;</p>
<div></div>
<div class="_2gr9A _1jgss">
<div class="undefined _3G4uE _237A3  undefined"><img decoding="async" id="" src="https://i0.wp.com/akcdn.bangcdn.net/res/content/2020/10/04/20201004212058_-1196393940_3876356610512621855_480_306_80_webp.webp?w=678" data-recalc-dims="1" /></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>By that stage Watkins&#8217; treble had given Liverpool a hard task if they were to leave Villa Park with anything to show for their efforts, as Mo Salah&#8217;s goal had also been immediately cancelled out by John McGinn&#8217;s effort.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Ross Barkley then made it 5-1, before Salah pulled back another goal, but two strikes from Jack Grealish completed the rout.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Klopp continued: &#8220;We thought if we do the same stuff but slightly better. But we had to protect it better. We tried the system slightly, made it a bit clearer for the boys but all good moments leaded to nothing apart from the two goals for Mo.</p>
<div></div>
<p>&#8220;All their big moments led to a big chance or goal and that makes the difference. They were flying and we were open.</p>
<div></div>
<p>&#8220;All the things you should not do in a football match we did tonight. But credit to Aston Villa.</p>
<div></div>
<p><strong>What did you make of Liverpool&#8217;s performance against Aston Villa? Have your say below.</strong></p>
<div></div>
<div class="_2gr9A _1jgss">
<div class="undefined _3G4uE _237A3  undefined"><img decoding="async" id="" src="https://i0.wp.com/akcdn.bangcdn.net/res/content/2020/10/04/20201004212746_1504639325_788509080854756670_480_327_80_webp.webp?w=678" data-recalc-dims="1" /></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes we conceded deflected goals, one or two unlucky but not a properly blocked ball so our fault as well, but nobody to blame apart from us.&#8221;</p>
<div></div>
<p>Quizzed why he thought his side had &#8220;lost the plot&#8221;, the Reds&#8217; boss responded: &#8220;Absolutely unexpected but it happened. For me we put all of our rubbish things, mistakes, in one game.</p>
<div></div>
<p>&#8220;Last week Mr [Roy] Keane said it was sloppy. It was not sloppy tonight it was just bad.</p>
<div></div>
<p>&#8220;I have to admit that but I cannot change it now.</p>
<div></div>
<p>&#8220;I would love to have a training session tomorrow and speak about but the boys go out with the national team.</p>

<p>The former Red Devils’ defender expressed his fury in the aftermath of his old side’s<a style="line-height: 1.5" type="anchor"> horrific performance</a><span style="line-height: 1.5">, which left him considering his position in punditry.</span></p>

<div></div>
<p>Evra began: “Alexis Sanchez made a comment. He said when he signed for United at his first training session he asked his agent to end up his contract.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“That’s what I’m going to ask to Sky. I really would like to end my contract with Sky.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“Because it’s my second game, I’m a positive person and I never want to talk about United because when you tell the truth it can hurt and I’m passionate and I love my club.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“I know you have to have some filter when you talk on TV, but it’s a shambles…</p>

</div>
<div></div>
<p>“Tonight, no-one has any excuse, they let down all the United fans.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“And I don’t care about the result because I’ve been beat 6-1. It’s just about every year it’s the same story.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“I feel now what all the United fans [feel]. That’s why I’d prefer to comment different games than the United games if I keep working for Sky.”</p>

</div>
<div></div>
<p>United had the dream start as they were awarded a penalty after just 23 seconds and Bruno Fernandes coolly found the bottom corner.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Spurs were level just two minutes later as Tanguy Ndombele drilled home from close range after some shoddy defending from Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The fast opening at Old Trafford continued as</p>
<p><a type="anchor"> Spurs </a>scored a second in the seventh minute as Kane’s quick free-kick played Son in and the South Korean made no mistake.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Then Martial saw red for lashing out with a slap on Erik Lamela before a Tottenham corner.</p>
<div></div>
<div class="_2gr9A _1jgss">

</div>
<div></div>
<p>Three minutes later Spurs made it three as</p>
<p><a type="anchor"> Kane </a>got on the scoresheet, but it was suicidal defending from United as Bailly played a loose ball, Kane won it back and was then on hand to fire home after Son had set him up.</p>
<div></div>
<p>United were in utter disarray and Spurs made it 4-1 in the 37th minute as Serge Aurier was allowed far too much space down the right and he crossed for Son who rolled home from close range.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Half-time did not bring any respite as Aurier picked his spot in the 51st minute after Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg sliced United open.</p>
<div></div>
<p>It got even worse for the hosts as they gave away a penalty of their own, which Kane rifled into the top-left corner to make it 6-1 – the game’s final score.</p>
<div></div>
<div class="_2gr9A _1jgss">

</div>
<div></div>
<p>Evra later added: “What’s going on with my club? What’s going on right now?</p>
<div></div>
<p>“I’m really emotional. It’s difficult to talk – a man like me I’m a positive person.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“I don’t promote violence, but many people need some good slap right now in the team.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“That’s what I would do right now if I’m working for the club…</p>
<div></div>
<p>“I know you laugh, but I really don’t wanna laugh right now. I’m really, really angry.”</p>

<p>Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has said that Spurs defeated Manchester United 6-1 in the Premier League because his team prepared very well tactically and psychologically.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Mourinho’s side defeated Man United at Old Trafford, thanks to goals from Tanguy Ndombele, Son Heung-min (2), Harry Kane (2), and Serge Aurier.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Bruno Fernandes did score for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Speaking after the game, Mourinho told Sky Sports: “Manchester United does nOt lose many matches, to lose by six is of course not every day. Historical victory but in the end three points and three very important points because we lost five points at home.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“We prepared ourselves very well tactically and also psychologically, the team was ready. So ready that a penalty in the first minute and going 1-0 down didn’t affect the team at all.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“Some people can say you play against 10 men for a long time which is true but for me it’s also true that 11 v 11 we were playing extremely well, we were creating huge problems, we were winning 2-1 and they couldn’t find solutions to control us.”</p>

</div>
<p>Donald Trump, U.S President</p>
<div></div>
<p>President Donald Trump’s infection with COVID-19 about 32 days to the United States presidential election may prompt the Republic Party to consider a ‘hypothetical’ replacement as its candidate in the November 3 poll.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Trump had announced on Friday that he and the U.S. First Lady, Melania Trump, had tested positive for the virus.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The U.S. president’s physician, Sean Conley, had also confirmed the development, saying: “The President and First Lady are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence”.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The 74-year-old is at higher risk of complications from the virus due to his age.</p>
<div></div>
<p>With the U.S. presidential election around the corner, the Republican National Committee (RNC) could replace Trump on the party’s ticket and nominate a new candidate in the event that the president’s health deteriorates and is unable to continue with the polls, reports Daily Mail.</p>
<div></div>
<p>If that becomes the case, the Republican Party may vote to nominate the party’s vice-presidential candidate or another member of the party, as its candidate.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Another possibility is that the Vice President, Mike Pence, may take over executive control in the event that Trump becomes incapacitated.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Also, one of Trump’s political foes, Nancy Pelosi, who is the Speaker of U.S House of Representatives, would be the next in line of succession if Pence is unable to assume control, according to provisions of the amended U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>United States President Donald Trump and his wife have tested positive for the Coronavirus.</p>
<div></div>
<p>He disclosed this in a tweet on Friday.</p>
<div></div>
<p>He assured that they would recover quickly.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!,” he tweeted.</p>
<div></div>
<p>This is a developing story. .</p>

<p><strong>A five-man panel of the Appellate Court has overturned a ruling which nullified the election of Douye Diri as governor of Bayelsa State.</strong></p>
<div></div>
<p>The court held that the Bayelsa Election Petition Tribunal acted outside its jurisdiction by nullifying the election of Governor Diri.</p>
<div></div>
<p>In a unanimous judgment, the five-man panel of the court said the Advanced Nigeria Democratic Party failed woefully to show that it had a valid candidate that was unlawfully excluded by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).</p>
<div></div>
<p>The court berated the tribunal for ignoring the fact that the petition of ANDP was status barred in addition to the fact that the party presented an unqualified candidate to INEC in the November 16, 2019 Governorship election in Bayelsa State.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump has said he and First Lady Melania Trump have tested positive for coronavirus and are now in quarantine.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The president, aged 74, announced the news in a tweet. “We will get through this together,” he wrote.</p>
<div></div>
<p>It comes after one of Mr Trump’s closest aides tested positive for coronavirus.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Hope Hicks, the 31-year-old adviser to the president, was the closest aide to Mr Trump to test positive so far.</p>
<div></div>
<p>She travelled with him on Air Force One to a TV debate in Ohio this week.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>Late on Thursday, Mr Trump had said he and his wife were going into quarantine after Ms Hicks’s positive test.</p>
<div></div>
<p>He tweeted: “Hope Hicks, who has been working so hard without even taking a small break, has just tested positive for Covid 19. Terrible!</p>
<div></div>
<p>“The First Lady and I are waiting for our test results. In the meantime, we will begin our quarantine process!”</p>
<div></div>
<p>It is not clear how Mr Trump’s positive test will affect arrangements for the second presidential debate, which is scheduled for 15 October in Miami, Florida.</p>
