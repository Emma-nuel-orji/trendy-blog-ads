<p>They will kill me; they will kill the President Elect, Chief MKO Abiola if I went ahead with the election and announced the winner of the elections which we all know to be Bashorun, Chief MKO Abiola.<br>I know so; I am not daft.<br>He won; he tried. I feel bad about the whole matter.<br>Professor, I do not see how they will spare you because they know you are my principal confidant. You think they do not know you? They know; they know you are with me now. They saw you coming in and they know you are with me now I cannot kill myself for the sake of what the country wants. I am sorry, he lamented. It was astonishing to hear a General state that he could not lay down his life for his country.</p>



<p>It was clear that General Babangida was in a fix as of June 21st 1993. I then proceeded to deal with the questions of who were these “they” and for what reasons would they want to kill the President and the President Elect if the June 12 election were allowed to go forward. He named them in military and in ethnic categories:</p>



<p>Sani (meaning General Sani Abacha) is opposed to a return to civilian rule. Sani cannot stand the idea of Chief Abiola, a Yoruba becoming his Commander- in- Chief; Sani seems to have the ears of the Norhern leaders that no Southerner especially from the South West should become the President of the country. Sani seems to rally the Northern elders to confront me on the matter. He is winning; the Sultan and the Northern leaders are of this frame of mind.</p>



<p>Where do I go from here? They do not trust me. Without Sani, I will not be alive today; without the North, I would not have become an officer in the Nigerian Army and now the President of Nigeria I don’t want to appear ungrateful to Sani; he may not be bright upstairs but he knows how to overthrow governments and overpower coup plotters. He saw to my coming to office in 1985 and to my protection in the many coups I faced in the past, especially the Orkar coup of 1990 where he saved me and my family including my infant daughter.”</p>



<p>Sani risked his life to get me into office in 1983 and 1985; if he says he does not want Chief Abiola, I will not force Chief Abiola on him. He also named Lt General Dongoyaro and Brigadier General David Mark as those who were against Chief Abiola.<br>In fact, he quoted David Mark as saying: I’d shoot Chief Abiola the day NEC( National Electoral Commission) pronounces him the elected President!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As Facebook continues to spotlight exemplary Nigerians whose work has helped put Nigeria and Africa as a whole on the global map with the ‘Made by Africa: Loved by the World’ campaign, the name Mark Angel comes to mind as this name and the brand it represents has become such a strong force to reckon with in the comedy industry today.</p>



<p>The brand enjoys a large following of over 17 million followers on Facebook and over 1 million followers on Instagram.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no doubt that the content produced by&nbsp;<a href="https://web.facebook.com/markangelcomedy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Angel</a>&nbsp;has endeared the hearts of millions all over the world. In 2016, Emmanuella was awarded the&nbsp;<em>“Princess of Comedy&#8221;&nbsp;</em>title as well as&nbsp;<em>“Best New Comedienne,”</em>&nbsp;at the Afro Australia Music and Movie Awards (AAMMA 2016) in far away Syndey Australia.</p>



<p>Mark Angel currently ranks as the most popular Nigerian brand on Facebook with the largest number of followers. But what has made Mark Angel become such a recognizable name in comedy today?<br><br>&nbsp;Let’s consider&nbsp;<strong><em>five simple Facebook tips</em></strong>&nbsp;that helped Mark Angel achieve such feats online.</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Don’t get discouraged with the followers/engagement at first</strong></li></ol>



<p>According to Mark Angel himself, the first video they posted on social media only got four views. But today, his Facebook page boasts over 17 million followers, and his videos easily get a combined view of over a million on average on all social media platforms weekly. All this has happened because he and his team didn&#8217;t get discouraged by the low response they got at first.</p>



<ol type="1" start="2"><li><strong>Don’t just focus on content. Learn a Skill</strong></li></ol>



<p>Having learnt cinematography from faraway India, Mark Angel didn’t allow his focus to simply be on content creation.&nbsp; According to Mark Angel, he spent over $100 (over ₦40,000 naira based on current exchange rates) to learn how to edit videos as it is possible to get disappointed by those who are skilled in this area anytime.</p>



<ol type="1" start="3"><li><strong>Invest in equipment</strong></li></ol>



<p>&nbsp;Mark invested $5,000 (over ₦2 million) on equipment and also invested in getting a production team. The results of that investment today are obvious as the quality of his video production greatly improved. Today, the Mark Angel brand has equipment worth a lot more than $50,000 (₦20 million).</p>



<ol type="1" start="4"><li><strong>Be consistent</strong></li></ol>



<p>Every Friday, the Mark Angel team makes sure that content is posted on all social media platforms. This creates a regular sense of expectation in the heart of the fans as they always know when to expect content. To make this happen, the team obviously has to make sure all the requisite content is ready for posting before Friday.</p>



<ol type="1" start="5"><li><strong>Be original</strong></li></ol>



<p>Mark Angel prides itself as being one of the first brands in the comedy skits producing sector to feature children as stars and main characters with Emmanuella having grown in fame and popularity over the years. This obviously has become a niche for the brand as they have recently been seen to include other children in different episodes, popularly among which is teenage sensation, Success.</p>



<p>Watch his story on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookappAfrica/" target="_blank">official Facebook Africa page</a> and on a dedicated ‘Made by Africa, Loved by the World’ microsite to get a glimpse into the growth and success of Mark Angel, the African creative whose comedy is loved by the world.</p>

<p><strong>Bandits alledly invade farm of  Emir of Kontagora, Alh. Bashir Namaska, and killed his first Son alongside others working on the farm at Masuga village along the Kontagora-Rijau Road in Niger State.</strong></p>



<p>The traditional ruler’s son was the Sardauna of Kontagora and had been holding the fort for his father, the Sarkin Sudan, who was reported to have been sick for some months.</p>



<p>He was said to have been shot by the bandits on Thursday and later rushed to the hospital where he was confirmed dead on arrival.</p>



<p>Sources said the bandits also abducted some persons on their way out of the town in the north-central region of the country.</p>



<p>In his reaction, Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello, described the death of the prince as heart-breaking and devastating and condoled with the emir and the people of Kontagora Emirate over the loss.</p>



<p>“It is really disheartening to hear about the death of Bashir, especially at a time when intense military operations are ongoing in some parts of the state to rid the state of criminal elements.</p>



<p>“As painful as the death is, the situation will only spur my administration to ensure that the fight against banditry in the state is won,” the governor said.</p>



<p>He added, “My deepest condolence goes to the Emir and the people of Kontagora Emirate as this is indeed a great loss, but we should all be consoled by the fact that it is a necessary end for all mortals”.</p>



<p>Governor Bello prayed to God to forgive all the shortcomings of the late prince and give his father, the people of the emirate, and his close associates the fortitude to bear the loss.</p>



<p>Born in 1979, late Bashir served Kontagora Emirate in many capacities, among which were the District Head of Kontagora I and Sardaunan Kontagora, the positions he held until his demise.</p>



<p>He was also the Director-General of the Niger State Public Procurement Board between 2013 and 2015.</p>

<p>Bauchi state government says it will commence the implementations of banning of motorcycle rider in the state.</p>



<p>The State Road and Traffic Agency (BAROTA) who disclose the development to newsmen sa&#8217;ad that the implementation of law banning commercial motorcycle operation, passed one year ago by the state governor will soon be enforced</p>



<p>BAROTA chairman, Air Commodore Tijjani Baba Gamawa, while briefing newsmen on Tuesday, said that the law would take full effect on defaulters.</p>



<p>According to him, over 290 ‘illegal’ traders had been relocated and over 100 road traffic offenders had been arrested. He added that through payment of fines, the agency had raked in over N4 million in three months into the government treasury.</p>



<p>Tijani warned drivers and riders to adhere to the traffic laws of the state, saying that defaulters stand to pay a fine ranging from N5,000 to N20,000.</p>



<p>He said: “Commercial motorcycles remain banned in Bauchi State. There is no commercial motorcycling in Bauchi State. I want to bring to the notice of good people of Bauchi State that the law is still there and we are going to implement it immediately.”</p>

<p>The marriage produced three children who are said to be suffering from Sickle Cell Anaemia.</p>



<p>Kelly Felix fled after he defrauded Helen of landed property. Kelly is also said to have married Helen with a false identity, Moses Adams Iluobe, his elder brother&#8217;s name.</p>



<p>According to reports, Kelly, alongside his surety, Festus Idemudia, has been captured by sexcurity operatives of Akinpelu Police Station Oshodi and transferred to the Gender/Anti-Human Trafficking Unit, State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, Yaba.</p>



<p>A report by a mandated reporter read, &#8220;Helen has two daughters living with Sickle Cell Anemia due to the deceitful ways of her husband who lied about his genotype that he&#8217;s AA meanwhile he&#8217;s actually AS.</p>



<p>&#8220;The fraudulent husband, Felix Kelly Iluobe got married to another woman in September 2020 in Edo State.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kelly used his elder brother&#8217;s name, Moses Adams Iluobe to get a marriage certificate at the high court, bearing Helen and Kelly&#8217;s picture but with Kelly&#8217;s elder brother&#8217;s name – Moses Adams Iluobe.</p>



<p>&#8220;The good news is Kelly Felix Iluobe&#8217;s elder brother, Moses Adams Iluobe, whose name appear in all Kelly Iluobe&#8217;s documents, has been arrested along with his surety, Festus Idemudia by the Officer-in-charge, Human Rights, Akinpelu Police Station, Oshodi and they were duly transferred to the Gender/Anti-Human Trafficking Unit, SCID, Panti.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kelly Iluobe is said to be outside Nigeria somewhere in Brazil, the usual fraudulent lie. We discovered Kelly Iluobe is working closely with his elder brother and his surety in defrauding women.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kelly did not only destroy Helen Iluobe, but he also duped her of a piece of land at Ijegun, which he sold despite not having original documents.</p>



<p>&#8220;When their first child passed away at the age of three, Kelly Iluobe showed no sign of concern whenever the remaining two surviving daughters suffered a crisis.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kelly Iluobe is in the habit of putting unsuspecting vulnerable ladies in the family way and moves on to another after he has sucked his prey dry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Garba Shehu, The senior Special assistant to Nigerian President, President Buhari, said that nobody can bring down the Buhari-led government down. </p>



<p>Garba said this when he appeared on Channels TV ON Friday, March 26. </p>



<p>Shehu the media to the president swhile responding to question over continue insecurity in the country gives reason he said nobody can bring down this government.</p>



<p>There have been agitations by secessionist groups calling for the removal of the Buhari government. </p>



<p>He said nobody can bring down Buhari  government because it is a government elected democratically. “I want to assure Nigerians that the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari is addressing multiple challenges that are facing the country especially in dealing with security and yet we are still making progress in agriculture, economy, anti-corruption. It is sad for the country that opposition is exploiting some of these things. It is quite unfortunate and I want to assure that the president remains focused in preserving the security and unity of this country. We accept that dissent is allowed, this is a democracy and people have a right to tell truth to government but we must be careful in doing that. Nobody can bring down the government because this is a government elected democratically. Government in a democracy come through periodic elections and if we have a government in office as we have, sponsored by political parties to win the elections, it is telling you that that confidence of the public is still there. People with strong ambitions, wait till four years, in fact, in our case, two more years to go to election and President Buhari will not be a candidate in that election” he said</p>
