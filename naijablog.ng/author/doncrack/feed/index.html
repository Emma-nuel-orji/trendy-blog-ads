<p>&#8220;The attention of LASG has been drawn to an online news quoting the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso, as saying fines ranging between N20,000 and N500,000 will be imposed on violators of the curfew on Dec. 31, 2020. This is inaccurate and misleading</p>



<p>“The government is advising residents to comply with COVID-19 protocols because the cases are rising. The role of religious organisations in fighting the pandemic is well noted.</p>



<p>“The Christian Association of Nigeria has issued a statement on how Churches should conduct their watchnight services.</p>



<p>“The Sanwo-Olu administration has maintained a harmonious relationship with religious organisations and has confidence in the ability of their leaders to ensure compliance with COVID-19 protocols amid the clamour for crossover services.”</p>

<p>A top hunter has been killed in a gun duel with some bandits in Kaduna State.</p>



<p>The hunter identified as Young Mori, who was the Head Of Operation of Adamawa State Hunters Association was killed on Tuesday, December 29.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12913429_5fec30fe94a1a_jpeg17e856525ea4061ef9c338c556982602-473x630.jpeg?resize=473%2C630&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-80886" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>It gathered that Mori assisted security operatives to tackle banditry and kidnapping in some part of the northern state.</p>



<p>The Head Of Administration of the group, Salihu Wobkenso confirmed the incident.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12913430_5fec3195c5e03_jpeg434115d383f58eb97e9e3af568d1e951.jpeg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-80887" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>”This is sad news to hunters. Young Mori, one of our hunters in Adamawa State from Guyuk LGA has been overpowered by cattle rustlers in Kaduna State in the early hours of today,” he said.</p>



<p>‘’The gallant General Young Mori has answered the home call, though you have gone by the will of God but your spirit is still with us. Rest well, Zwalka Nungurau,’’ said one Johnson Gwadamdi.</p>
