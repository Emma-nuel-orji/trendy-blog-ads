<p>In its commitment towards promoting science and technology education in Adamawa, the state government has procured mobile teaching aids for science subjects to distribute across secondary schools across.</p>



<p>This development is coming after the government recently announced recruitment of two thousand science teachers in the state for existing vacancies all aimed at enhancing teaching and learning of science subjects.</p>



<p>The Secretary to the State Government SSG, Malam Bashir Ahmad alongside some Commissioners and other top government officials inspected the equipment at Government Girls Secondary School GGSS, Yola Thursday.</p>



<p>Speaking to newsmen in an interview after he was conducted round the equipment, Malam Ahmad explained that government procured the mobile teaching aides inline with the efforts of Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri led administration to improve education sector.</p>



<p>He said the equipment will ease students understanding of science and technology subjects, thereby improving learning outcomes and assured that government will soon distribute them as schools in Adamawa will resume in the next two weeks.</p>



<p>The Secretary to the State Government who was also conducted round some science teaching aides procured by the previous administration expressed concern that the equipment were kept without being put into use for over a long time.</p>



<p>According to the SSG, lack of effective utilization of the equipment as and when due after being purchased by government has contributed to the low performance of students in science subjects in the previous years.</p>



<p>On her part, the Commissioner of Education and Human Capital Development, Mrs Wilbina Jackson said the mobile science teaching aids were purchased by the Fintiri led administration for use in places where there is no laboratory.</p>



<p>She added that mobile laboratory is a concept used in some states like Kaduna where it was introduced successfully and further said the equipment are for teaching science subjects such as Phisics, Chemistry, Biology and Agric Science among others.</p>



<p>She said soon, her ministry will invite all education stakeholders in the state to come and also inspects the equipment and proffer advice on how the equipment will be distributed to all post basic and secondary schools in Adamawa.</p>

<p>* Delivering Governor Bunis Palliative to Vulnerable Population.</p>



<p>SEMA upon receipt of community concern raised by stakeholders on scarcity of food due to season before harvest challenges in 8 communities neighboring Tulo Tulo in Yusufari LGA and Subsequent approval and directive by His Excellency to intervene…</p>



<p>A response team was Mobilised lead by ES SEMA to reach out to over 400HH in the 8 Communities with Food items.</p>



<p>Though a HARD &#8211; 2- REACH community, the team found it fulfilling to ensure the Palliatives were delivered  Hand 2 Hand. The team were able to overcome challenges when the Trailer full load with Food Items had accident and somersaults in to a ditch by mobilizing Local trucks to convey and ensure food items delivered as directed.</p>



<p>Though delivered late in the evening, the beneficiaries didn&#8217;t wait in vain nor sent home to come again.. They were validated and Palliatives provided same day as directed.</p>



<p>SEMA wish to specifically thank Hon commissioner of Health and as well Yusufari DPM for thier untiring efforts.</p>

<p>…As Governor receives GOC 3 Div</p>



<p>Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State has said that no price is too big for his administration to pay for the people to enjoy maximum peace and security in the state.</p>



<p>The Governor stated this when he granted audience to the Acting General Officer Commanding, 3 Division, Jos, Brigadier-General Musa Danmadami who is in the State on an operational tour.</p>



<p>Governor Yahaya told the GOC and members of his entourage that while in the state, they should equally interact with the people to appreciate their fears in respect to security challenges facing them and the state.</p>



<p>He said the GOC&#8217;s visit which came barely two weeks after the Chief of Army Staff came calling, indicates how concerned and determined the Nigerian Army is to protect the peace in the State and by extension to restore calm in troubled spots across the country.</p>



<p>The Governor described the visit as necessary to understanding the dynamics of security in the state without which the army may find it difficult to profer solution.</p>



<p>&#8220;While you go round your military formations it is equally important to visit those places that are very vulnerable to attacks and threats so that you can know how to tackle them&#8221;.</p>



<p>He thanked the Army for the support Gombe State has been receiving from it but however noted that the peace and the location of the state at the centre of the North East makes it a safe haven for fleeing IDPs which may pose threat to the continuous peace of the state.</p>



<p>The Governor informed the visiting GOC that the mountainous area between Shongom Local Government Area of Gombe State and Karim Lamido of Taraba State has been a home to criminal elements who are hell bent on disturbing the peace and means of livelihood of the people.</p>



<p>&#8220;As you rightly said that Gombe is a peaceful state in the region, so if you allow Gombe to slip up and fall into that category then God forbid, the whole region will be having a problem and you can imagine 22 million people falling into danger&#8221;.</p>



<p>He charged the Army to redouble its efforts in maintaining the peace, as according to the Governor &#8220;instead of trouble coming in here, let peace reach out to them so that the whole subregion will be peaceful&#8221;.</p>



<p>He said inspite of the economic depression being experienced across the world due to the covid-19 Pandemic, his administration will not shy away from doing everything necessary to support the constitutional mandate of the Nigerian Military in maintaining peace and order in the state.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our political will can never be shaken in fact this is the only State in the region that has an entire Ministry for Internal security and Ethical Orientation, it was not by accident but by design to have such a Ministry because of our love for peace&#8221;.</p>



<p>Earlier speaking the Acting General Officer Commanding 3rd Armour Division Brigadier General Musa Danmadami said he was in the State on a familiarization tour of commands under the sphere of influence of the Division.</p>



<p>He said as the chief security officer of the state, it is mandatory for him to come and interact with the Governor and members of his cabinet on the dynamics of security in the State.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is no doubt that the state under your leadership has provided enormous support to the Division through the 301 Artillery Regiment Gombe&#8221;.</p>



<p>He commended the Gombe State Governor for the continuous support and appealed for such to be maintained even as the 301 Artillery Regiment makes plans to relocate to its permanent site along Gombe-Kumo road.</p>



<p>Brigadier General Musa Danmadami said he is of the view that crisis of whatever sort can only be addressed through political solution, a trait he said is inherent in Governor Inuwa Yahaya because of his administration&#8217;s commitment in carrying every section of the state along.</p>

<p>The Nigeria&#8217;s premier non-interest Jaiz Bank Plc, has been nominated as the most improved Islamic Bank in the world by the Global Islamic Finance Awards (GIFA).</p>



<p>Chairman, Global Islamic Finance Awards (GIFA), Prof. Humayon Dar, said the awards committee picked Jaiz Bank as the best out of three organisations considered.</p>



<p>According to him, Jaiz Bank was chosen after long deliberations based on some factors which included GIFA Methodology.</p>



<p>The GIFA methodology – on which the awards are based and winners selected – is the most detailed approach to screen only the best of the best in their respective award categories. Basically, there are three factors considered in the selection of a winner. These include social responsibility, Shari’a authenticity and commitment to Islamic banking and finance.</p>



<p>An organisation is considered socially responsible if it makes efforts to behave ethically and contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of its employees and the local community and society at large.</p>



<p>An organisation is considered Shari’a authentic if it commits itself to the Shari’a standards issued by an independent body like the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Finance Institutions (AAOIFI) or a national body set up to issue Shari’a guidelines.</p>



<p>Also, the selection criteria allocate a maximum point to full-fledged, stand-alone Islamic banks and financial institutions.</p>



<p>According to the awards committee, Jaiz Bank was able to meet all the three primary factors, hence it was selected as the winner.</p>

<p><em>*Meet four princes jostling for Emir of Zazzau throne</em></p>



<p>Following the death of the Emir of Zazzau, four princes from eligible ruling houses of Zazzau Emirate are jostling to replace the Emir.<br>Emir Shehu Idris, 84-year-old died on Sunday, September 20.</p>



<p><br>Mr Idris spent 45 years on the throne, having ascended the position in 1975 after the death of Muhammadu Aminu, the 17th emir since the 1804 Fulani Jihad.</p>



<p><br>By tradition, a new emir is expected to emerge from any one of the four ruling clans of the emirate. The ruling houses are Katsinawa, Mallawa, Bare-bari and Sullubawa. The late Emir Idris was from the Katsinawa ruling house.</p>



<p><br>Typically, the Kaduna State Government is expected to announce the new emir after the governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai, must have approved any of the princes nominate to him by the Zazzau kingmakers.</p>



<p><br>The kingmakers are Wazirin Zazzau, Ibrahim Aminu; Makaman Zazzau, Muhammad Abbas; Fagachin Zazzau, Umar Muhammad; Limamin Gari, Dalhatu Kasim and Limamin Kona, Muhammad Aliyu.</p>



<p><br>Those being mentioned as stronger contenders to the throne are the Iyan Zazzau, Bashir Aminu; Yeriman Zazzau, Munir Ja’afaru; Magajin Garin Zazzau, Ahmed Bamalli and Turakin Zazzau, Bashir Idris.</p>



<p><br>There are, however, other princes who are said to be eyeing the position. In this category are Wamban Zazzau, Abdulkareem Aminu, Sarkin Kudun Zazzau Sambo Idris, and a few other sons of the deceased emir.</p>

<p>The Executive Secretary of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND), Prof Elias Bogoro has commended the governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello on the establishment of the Confluence University of Science and Technology, Osara, Kogi State.</p>



<p>Prof Bogoro who received Governor Bello who was on a working visit to his office, stated that the effort of the state governor in establishing a specialised university in the state was a laudable one, assuring that the agency will give maximum support to the new university.</p>



<p>Prof Bogoro said TETFUND has core objective of providing funding for educational facilities and infrastructural developments across the country.</p>



<p>He said the mandate of TETFUND also include promoting creative and innovative approach to educational learning and services and to stimulate, support and enhance improvement activities in the educational foundation areas, like teachers&#8217; education, teaching practice, library development and special education programmes.</p>



<p>He noted the Confluence Univeristy of Science and Techmology which is a specialised tertiary institution will enjoy the support of the agency just like all other tertiary institutions in the country.</p>



<p>Prof Bogoro said the idea of setting up a university of science and technology by the state government was a well-thought out one, noting that it will bridge the human capacity gap in the nation&#8217;s industries.</p>



<p>Earlier, the Kogi state governor, Yahaya Bello stated that the aim of his visit was to brief the Executive Secretary of the agency on the establishment of the Confluence University of Science and Technology, Osara, and to as well seek supports for the rapid development of the institution. The Governor disclosed that funds necessary for the takeoff of the school project have been earmarked but stressed that agency such as TETFUND and relevant international organisations are called upon to assist in the development of the new institution. He said in an era where almost everything are done with technology, an institutions like the Confluence University of Science and Technology will provide the needed manpower for the country in her technological advancement.</p>



<p>It will be recalled that governor Bello had in August 2020 assented to the bill for the establishment of Confluence University of Science and Technology earlier passed by the Kogi State House of Assembly.</p>
