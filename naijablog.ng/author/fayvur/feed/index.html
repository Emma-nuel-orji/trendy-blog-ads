<p>Osun State government has received 15 trafficked girls from Lebanon. They were received by Mrs Olubukola Olaboopo, Commissioner For Women, Children and Social Affairs and the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Diaspora Matters, Mrs Titi Fadahunsi-Ajayi.</p>
<p>In her remarks, Olaboopo said that the government was happy to receive the girls alive from Lebanon.</p>
<p>The commissioner said that the state government had put necessary measures in place for their reintegration into the society. She said,</p>
<p>“I welcome our ladies back to the state of Omoluabi. You are safe in the state, and the government will do all that it can to ensure that you have a good life going forward.</p>
<p>There is no harm in trying. The fact that you went abroad to hustle does not mean that you should be stigmatised.</p>
<p>We as government are very proud of you for taking a bold step and trying something new.</p>
<p>You have had the experience first hand, and you are going to be the state’s ambassadors on issues of trafficking.</p>
<p>The state government expects you to put in diligence in serving your motherland. You have seen the other side of life, and of course, you can see that there is no greener pasture anywhere, but home.</p>
<p>We want to know your qualifications to know how the government can assist you.</p>
<p>Besides, we have organised an Empowerment Programme for you, and your resource persons are on ground to take you through the training.&#8221;</p>

<p>Abubakar Malami, the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), has said that if he is invited by the Justice Ayo Salami-led presidential investigative panel, he is ready to testify against the suspended acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu.</p>
<p>A panel headed by Mr Salami, a former president of the Court of Appeal, is currently investigating Mr Magu over allegations of graft and insubordination levelled against him by Mr Malami.</p>
<p>The complaint of Mr Malami led to the suspension of Mr Magu as acting EFCC chairman, after the investigation of the activities of the latter at the EFCC from May 2015 to May 2020.</p>
<p>The AGF was reacting to a letter by Wahab Shittu, counsel to Mr Magu, dated September 4 and addressed to the committee chairman, demanding that Mr Malami, appear before the panel to provide evidence regarding his allegations against his client.</p>
<p>He said that his appearance before the tribunal of Inquiry would ensure a fair hearing.</p>
<p>Citing Sections 5(c) and 6 of the Tribunals of Inquiry Act 2004, Mr Shittu said that the tribunal has “the power to summon any person in Nigeria to attend any meeting of the tribunal to give evidence or produce any document or other thing in his possession and to examine him as a witness or require him to produce any document or other thing in his possession, subject to all just exceptions.</p>

<p>Lupita Nyong&#8217;o has shared a moving tribute to her Black Panther co-star and friend Chadwick Boseman, after he passed away after a four year battle with colon cancer.</p>
<p>She wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn’t make sense. The news is a punch to my gut every morning. Chadwick was a man who made the most of his time, and somehow also managed to take his time.</p>
<p>When we came together to make Black Panther, I remember being struck by his quiet, powerful presence&#8230; Chadwick’s hands were strong enough to carry the weight of the film and free enough to clasp mine when I needed it.”</p>
<p>Since the actor’s death, friends and fans have spoken of the impact his work had on them.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-71677" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/School-.jpg?resize=474%2C287&#038;ssl=1" alt="School reopening : UN urges Nigeria to adhere to COVID-19 safety precautions" width="474" height="287" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In line with school reopening in Nigeria, the United Nations has called on state authorities in the country to ensure that safety protocols against the spread of COVID-19 are in place before the full reopening of schools.</p>
<p>The agency said that about 46 million primary and secondary learners across Nigeria are affected due to pandemic-related school closures.</p>
<p>Edward Kallon, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, made this known in a statement in commemoration of the World International Day to Protect Education from Attack.</p>
<p>The theme for the Day this year is: “Protect Education, Save a Generation.”</p>
<p>Mr Kallon said that prioritising safety in schools for educators and learners would be an indication of the government’s commitment to protecting investments in the education sector and a validation of Nigeria’s endorsement of the Safe Schools Declaration.</p>
<p>He said,</p>
<p>“As State Governments plan to reopen schools after prolonged closures, building a resilient education system to withstand future shocks should be included in pandemic response plans.</p>
<p>Education is essential to helping crisis-affected communities in the north-east rebuild and recover. Attacks on schools are a direct attack on future generations.</p>
<p>I call on all parties to the conflict to take all necessary measures to protect education and give learners a chance to build a brighter future.&#8221;</p>

<p>President Buhari has said that US President, Donald Trump has once asked him why he was killing Christians.</p>
<p>Buhari said that Trump posed the question in the heat of the farmers-herders clashes in the country’s north central region and the reprisal attacks involving Muslim and Christian communities in the north.⁣</p>
<p>He said,<br />
⁣<br />
“I believe I was about the only African among the less developed countries the President of the United States invited.<br />
⁣<br />
⁣When I was in his office, only myself and himself, only God is my witness, he looked at me in the face, he asked, ‘why are you killing Christians?’⁣&#8221;<br />
⁣<br />
The President said that it took a lot of restraint on his part not to flare up and that he hoped his emotions on the day didn’t betray him.⁣ He said,<br />
⁣<br />
“I wonder, if you were the person, how you will react? I hope what I was feeling inside did not betray my emotion, so I told him that the problem between the cattle rearers and stagnant farmers, I know is older than me not to talk of him. I think I am a couple of years older than him&#8221;.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-71669" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Uti-.jpg?resize=198%2C372&#038;ssl=1" alt="Uti Nwachukwu begs Tacha for forgiveness" width="198" height="372" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Uti Nwachukwu has appealed to former BBNaija Season 4 housemate, Tacha to let bygones be bygones.⁣<br />
⁣<br />
He has apologised to reality TV star, Natasha Akhide for the comments he made about her after she was disqualified from the fourth season of reality TV show, Big Brother Naija.⁣</p>
<p>In a lengthy post shared via his Instagram page on Tuesday, September 8, 2020, Uti was remorseful as he recounted all that transpired after Tacha&#8217;s disqualification.⁣</p>
<p>He wrote,<br />
⁣<br />
&#8220;You will never understand till it happens to you” &#8211; popular saying I will never be too proud to acknowledge my personal epiphanies and when it’s time to actually obey ur conscience which I always say is your spirit.<br />
⁣<br />
Call it karma call it a wake-up call. But you always have to listen to that voice inside Recent events have triggered memories from last year’s #bbnaija When another housemate was disqualified. Let’s just say, now I know how it feels for her and her fans.<br />
⁣<br />
Most importantly, I am deeply regretful for the harsh words I tweeted when I felt provoked by her passionate FANS who were upset.</p>
<p>It was not fair to her as she had PERSONALLY not done anything to ME. My reactions to the insults were wrong and not inspired from a place of Love which I always champion&#8221;<br />
⁣<br />
How others treat us is no fault of ours. But how we respond/ REACT is fully up to us. An eye for an eye leaves the world Blind (I’m still learning this one sha cos sometimes the spirit of Gbas gbos is tooo strong lol).<br />
⁣<br />
I’m also someone that says, don’t insult me in public and then come and apologise privately. So symply_tacha I am extremely sorry for the mean tweets I responded with last year. Please accept my deepest apologies&#8221;⁣<br />
⁣<br />
He appealed to Tacha to extend an olive branch and let bygones be bygones.</p>
