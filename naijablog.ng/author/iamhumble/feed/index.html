										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong (CNN)China&#8217;s top leader Xi Jinping has issued the strongest warning yet against anyone who questions the country&#8217;s zero-Covid policy, as stringent, frequent lockdowns fuel public discontent and deal a devastating blow to the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>At a meeting chaired by Xi on Thursday, the ruling Communist Party&#8217;s supreme Politburo Standing Committee vowed to &#8220;unswervingly adhere to the general policy of &#8216;dynamic zero-Covid,&#8217; and resolutely fight against any words and acts that distort, doubt or deny our country&#8217;s epidemic prevention policies.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the first time Xi, who according to state media made an &#8220;important speech&#8221; at the meeting, has made public remarks about China&#8217;s battle against Covid since public furor erupted over the harsh lockdown in Shanghai.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our prevention and control strategy is determined by the party&#8217;s nature and mission, our policies can stand the test of history, our measures are scientific and effective,&#8221; the seven-member committee said, according to government news agency Xinhua.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have won the battle to defend Wuhan, and we will certainly be able to win the battle to defend Shanghai,&#8221; it said.</p>
