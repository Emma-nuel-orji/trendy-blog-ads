										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to an adage a problem shared is a problem half solved. Many are dying in silent with their ailment because they didn&#8217;t share with people, but running from pillar to post,whereas what they are looking for inside their Sokoto is just beside their house.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a 45 year old man living in Oyo state. i came to realize that hardship, delay and disappointment are all component of spirituality caused by either ourselves or imposed by enemies who are jealous about your future.This is because there is one on earth is born for hardship, delay or disappointment, but all these misfortune are orchestrated by lack of understanding the spiritualities of life. sincerely speaking, I use to make love with an unknown number of persons in the dream some times thrice in a month, but little did i know that having sex in the dream causes setback to ones life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Life became extremely difficult for me in every area of my endeavor. Those who were to be of help to me turned to be enemies of progress after promising heaven and earth. The issue of promise and fail became a recurring decimal in my life. I went to many places to seek for help, but all seems to be adding fuel to flame. I was tired and depressed at home hoping for nothing until i came across QUEEN MOTHER HEALING HOME. PHONE:07017419907</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Infact, the first question thrown on me by the spiritualist was exactly my experience during those innocent days of my life.The spiritualist said my problem started long ago with sexual manipulation through the dream land. It was then i realized that sex in the dream is disastrous to ones life. The spiritualist ordered me to get a native egg and use the egg for spiritual cleansing of my body and break it at the three junction in the midnight to free my self from hardship, delay and disappointment .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To say the least,i never knew an ordinary egg is as powerful as such. I became free from satanic manipulation up till this moment. My life has changed diametrically from worse to a great achiever within few months of my encounter with Queen mother healing home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The question is every one has problem, but how, when and where can we get positive answer to our problems is a daunting task.Many of us are so spiritually afflicted and inflicted, but we carnally condemned those that are endowed with powers to suppress the wicked and unrepentant enemies of our lives. Spiritual endowment is a grace and gift to many family lineage and they use it to save life and deliver the oppressed from their oppressors. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was a staunch opposition to those who claimed to be spiritualist, but not all are not fake.The genuine ones are rare, but are full of blessing to mankind . You may take it or leave it, but only those who passed through the ordeals of life and became free after series of struggle will agree with me. Those who may have thought of the native aspect of spiritualist perhaps didn&#8217;t know that there are people among them that genuinely endowed to provide answers to problem that defies human comprehension and medical interpretation and answer until they meet the right people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life is expressly what you make out of it otherwise it is meaningless.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many people are just living, but they are not in life because they allow their glory to be trampled under their foot without knowing it. Many have engaged in crime as their desire out run their abilities leading to untimely death in many cases.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am a 42 years old man from the Eastern part of the country.i have been living in abject poverty, but turned to a very rich man within a space of 2years.In my family i was a rejected stone because no one recognizes my input in the affairs of the family likewise my place of worship.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>According to a popular adage, success has many friends, but failure has none .My sudden wealthy life style attract the attention of many in the family and the society. I became the bread winner and the corner stone of the family. People tends to come around me for help.while in my place of worship,i became a financial pillar. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There were few backbiters accusing me of money ritual.They call me all sorts of names and advice friends and children to be far from me. In every aspect of life there is the pros and cons. When i was in abject poverty they mocked me and when i became rich they suspected me to be ritualist without knowing how i became rich.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Obviously, some of those who called me yahoo boy later realized that I was not when i publicly declared to them that the secret things belong to God, but the open things belong to us .I told my adversaries that i learn how to attract favour from highly placed personalities in the society without engaging in crime. QUEEN MOTHER HEALING HOME, PHONE:07017419907 was the answer to my eventual success in life after many years of suffering. With Queen mother healing home i learn the secret of grace, favour and attraction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Life wasn&#8217;t good to me at all in the past.i suffered hardship and rejection among my peers.i wanted the best out of life, but didn&#8217;t know what to do My testimony more sound incredible, but real. There is nothing impossible in the spiritual realm ,if you need it for the blessing of your life.it may take time,if you don&#8217;t know the right place to go. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In my quest to be great in life.i encountered difficulty that led to abandonment, rejection and humiliation, but today after my encounter with Queen mother healing home. I receives material and financial blessings like the flow of a river. The cars parked in my compound are gift from people who favoured me. The money i spends were sent to my account by people my life is attracted to in different ways.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is simply, logical, harmless and just a spiritual means of attracting favour to your life. I am made bold to testify because i didn&#8217;t in any way engage in crime or ritual but attracted to the favour of men without committing atrocities. Experience is the best teacher and the pragmatic way of learning makes you discover to recover.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The power behind garlic and olive oil mixture are too enormous. Ordinarily what i thought about garlic was to prepare food for consumption alone, but never know that garlic is also Spiritual and useful when mixed with olive oil can fight against witches.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am a 48 year old man from Ogun State and a victim of perpetual Spiritual attack by unknown enemies. Witches always gathered at back of my house at midnight with various forms of whispering at about 12:30am to 2 am. When this happens in the night i will either fall sick or any body in my household will fall at prey to their hands the following day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In an attempt to prevent this from occuring at the back of my house where a big tree was planted before i built my house. The tree was fell down after many sacrifices, but yet the witches fail to ceased . I decided to go extra mile to ensure that witches will not come around my house in the night. I met one popular Spiritual Doctor who was known for his spiritual proficiency and explained to him how witches are tormenting me. He gave me some leafs and herb tied together to block the witches from any further attack, but the reverse was the case.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The most worrisome aspect of it was that during the period of time i used what was given to me by the Spiritual doctor.i later discovered that he is a members of the witchcraft family and the attack was more intensified .my life was subject to perpetual sickness going from one hospital to another. So i went back to the Spiritual doctor and explained the lastest attack, but he was pretentious helpless.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I became confused and disturbed on what to do. I told some of my friends what my family was passing through in the hands of unknown witches. One of my old friend who has been in the Eastern part of the country who came to visit his aged mother in our community. He came to house and discovered that my social life has been reduced to zero. When he asked me of what happened. I told him how the witches disturbed me every night. He told me there is a Spiritualist who will solve the problem and because of my conciousnes he decided to gave me the address of the Spiritualist called Queen Mother Spiritual home. Contact +2347017419907,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Without time delay he assisted me to contacted the spiritualist and booked appointment the following day. I paid him a visit and the Spiritualist unveil the power behind garlic and olive oil mixture to prevent witches from further attack. The Spiritualist put garlic and olive oil mixture in a bottle with cover and gave to me. I was told to rub it at night including members of my family. Ever since i began to applying the garlic and olive oil mixture witches no longer torment me and my household.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The spiritual attack that always put me and members of my family to the hospital every week stopped completely. I am now free from Spiritual slavery from the hands of the witches.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> In case your life is been tormented by the witches .why can&#8217;t you contact Queen Mother Spiritual home for your problem. Your life will never be the same again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 36 years old woman from Ajah in Lagos State revealed how she got back her husband who left her for a rich sugar mummy two years ago.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>According to the woman her husband left her with 5 children and completely abandoned his home to marry a rich sugar mummy without knowing his where about suddenly came back to her in a mysterious way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She said trouble started when my husband dated the sugar mummy secretly. He sometimes came back home with unfounded money and gift items to me and the children. His suddenly luxury life style became a surprise to me and when i asked how come about his new behaviour considering his poor income. He replied it is God that is doing the Miracles to cater for the family needs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, he does this whenever he came late from work. So i became suspicious of the new behaviour and warned him to be careful with whatever gives him money. My persistent and continuous demand to know the secret of his sudden behaviour made him to left the house without notice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So i decided to look for a Spiritual solution to bring back my husband where ever he is hiding. At first i met a great pastor who prophesied my husband is not dead:, but enjoying his life with another woman. He asked me to sow seed of #25,000 which i did, but couldn&#8217;t see the break light of my husband.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A friend later introduced me to Queen Mother Spiritual home, phone+23407017419907, The Spiritualist said again my husband is safe, but got married to another woman in a secured environment not too far from home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Spiritualist promised that my husband will fight with his new wife,if i can buy the Spiritual items written in a piece of paper given to me. I glance at the items in the paper and went to the market and bought them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Spiritualist used the materials to tie and untie two baby toys and asked me to</p>
<p> repeat the same when i got home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Behold, after 7 days of the Spiritual engagement my husband came back home and begged for forgiveness of his behaviour. He further explained that he wasn&#8217;t with his memory, until last night when he discovered he was in a strange marriage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I decided to give this testimony in the social media because of men who may fall to the antics of sugar mummy . Money is both good and bad ,if you are not careful with who you exchange your love with. It may lead to the end of your marriage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a woman never you jump into conclusion yet when you find your self in such a situation. Endure and pray for your helper he will definitely locate you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In case you suspected such form of anormalies in your marriage . You may contact Queen Mother Spiritual home for solution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a great uproar at the premises of a new generation church in Umuahia Abia state where a 45 years old pastor was caught red handed by his trouble some wife when he was . making to married woman.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The pastor who was suspected having secret affairs with the woman long ago blame devil for the act. According to the pastor, he started having sex with the woman for over three years for almost every four days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He decided to put a stop to it when his wife suspected him and fought against the woman to desist from been too close to her husband. The woman stopped for a while, but later visited him for the continuation of their sexual activities. He wanted to resist her, but couldn&#8217;t do so for the fear of the unknown. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The pastor&#8217;s wife went further to warned the husband who is not a member of the church to give serious warning to his wife not to come closer to the pastor. The man wanted to know more deeper about the warning, but the pastor&#8217;s wife left without giving any reason.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The warning infuriated the husband of the woman and went to the pastor and complained about the warning given to him by his wife. The pastor who is very skillful in handling situation of this nature appealled to the husband not to be deterred about his wife behaviour because she is jealous of any body coming around him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The pastor wife went to Queen Mother Spiritual home phone+23407017419907, The pastor&#8217;s wife told the Spiritualist to assist her with power that can reveal the secret affairs of her husband with another married woman.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Spiritualist gave her list of what she will buy to carry out the assignment. She went to the spiritual shop and bought them for the operation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Spiritualist gave her a spiritual necklace that will give sign whenever her husband is having secret affairs with the woman. She went home awaiting for the necklace to give sign. One Sunday evening after service hours. Her necklace was shaking without stopping. She quickly recalled that this may be the sign the Spiritualist was talked about and went straight to her husband private room in the church where she caught her husband red handed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The pastor was caught having a good time with the woman live for over 5 minutes without seeing his wife who was watching at the entrance of the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As she shouted for help the whole people living around the area came to see the pastor and the promiscuous woman pleaded for forgiveness. The husband heard about it and ran to the church and discovered his wife and the pastor were beggining with their bodies laying flat on the ground.</p>
<p> </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pretty young lady from Benue State who is just 29 years old revealed how Baba rescue her for not allowing her womb to be used for ritual.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>According to the lady her boy friend took her to an herbalist who disguised himself as prophet would have used her womb for ritual,if not because of Baba who came for her rescue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The lady said her boy friend connived with the ritualist to use her womb for money ritual by having sex with the herbalist to open her womb spiritually. The herbalist who pretended as a Man of God said she can only conceive for her boyfriend by having Spiritual sex with him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mean while, her boyfriend has been urging her to conceive for him before they can get married but because of the love she have for him .She decided to follow him to the place. The boy friend accused her of been a barren lady for not conceiving to him for the number of years they have spent together in courtship.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The apparently worried lady was confused and told her boy friend to give her time to think about it and left the place immediately. Her boy friend threatened that ,if she refused to comply he may have no option than to leave her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The threat of the boyfriend made her to seek for advice from people and they all concluded that he is not ready to marry her because there are many alternative ways of looking for the fruit of the womb not by having sex with an herbalist.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of those</p>
<p> who advised her was unable to conceive for a number of years after married to her husband advised her to visit Chief Dr Ohanu Spiritual temple, phone+2348088077395. WhatsApp+2348088077395. Address No 43 college road Mgbidi Oru west along owerri-Onitsha Exp way, Imo state Nigeria. The woman was emphatic that the Spiritualist enable her to have the fruit of the womb after many visitation to hospital and other traditional doctors failed her woefully.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The lady located the address and discussed her predicament with the spiritualist who told her that she would have been used for money ritual,if not God that rescued her from the evil plans of the pretentious fake prophet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Spiritualist asked her to buy some few Spiritual items in the market and use them to open her womb. The Spiritualist further said,her womb have been blocked by enemies who doesn&#8217;t want her to bear children after marrige and the same people are responsible for her inability to get the rightful man God has chosen for her. Now that she has been set free from every form of Spiritual encoumbrances . She will meet a man who will love her wholeheartedly within 3 months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She came back home and eventually met a man who seek for her hand in marriage and they later got married with a big marrige celebration. Few months after their marriage she got pregnant and put to bed a bouncing baby boy. This was how Baba rescue her from the evil plans of her ex-boy friend who never love her , but wanted to use her womb for ritual.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In case you are looking for the fruit of the womb after being tired of Doctors medications and advise. You may contact Chief Dr Ohanu for solution. Baba doesn&#8217;t demand for your money at first, but interested in finding a lasting solution to your problem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a popular adage which says some disappointment may be appointment is actually a true statement of fact. I never believe the phrase before but it happened to me practically.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am a 36 years old man from Delta State. I worked with a private company in Lagos as an Accountant. I usually resume work as early as 6:45 am in order to escape the heavy traffic along Oworonshoki- Idumota express way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My boss don&#8217;t normally come to work early but he has never absented himself from work, except he travel out of the state. One fateful day. He came to work very early which is unusual and it surprises all staff.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My Boss became angry for any one that came few minutes after 8:00am. He started inspecting the offices one after the other and when he got to my office. He asked me to give him a break to break analysis of monthly income and expenditures of the company&#8217;s account for the first quarter of the year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I told to supply him a detailed analysis in the next three days. He became furious and threatened to sack me,if i do not come to his office with the analysis within two days instead of the three days i requested. This made me to work day and night in order to meet up with the ultimatum given by my Boss.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At exactly 4:00pm in the next day i gave him details of the revenue and expenditure account of the lst quarter of year 2019. My Boss was satisfied with the Job , but still threatened to lay off some staff owing to the effect of covid 19 pandemic. Few days later, he called a meeting of all staffers and said due to the prevailing economic situation of the country. He has no option than to disengage some staff. He however, didn&#8217;t mention the name of any body.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following day one of my co- staff secretly whispered to me that names of employees who have been disengaged from the services of the company has been pasted. I hurriedly went to the notice board and discoverd my name was written among the affected staff. I was completely devastated and don&#8217;t know what to do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My boss didn&#8217;t give us any parlliative and i went home with annoyance. I decided to seek for Job in government establishment to avoid sudden sack, but all my efforts were crowned in vain as there were no available job. I always went through job advert in the social media and red the testimony of a man who was in abject poverty, but got money through Spiritual means. I quickly copied the address as follows Chief Dr Ohanu Spiritual temple, phone+2348088077395, WhatsApp+2348088077395. Address No 43 college road Mgbidi Oru west along owerri-Onitsha Exp way,Imo state Nigeria. I called the Spiritualist who made him rich and booked appointment with him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Spiritualist told me to visit him the next day. I actually visited him because I was conscious of making money.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Spiritualist asked me to buy a big bag with a live cat. After all his spiritualities he asked me to open the bag and i discoverd it was full to the brim with the highest currency in the country. He told to repeat it every month end and this was how i became gradually rich and wealthy to the admiration of all and Sundry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In case you have been sacked by your boss in your place of work. I urged you to contact Chief Dr Ohanu for a Spiritual solution. Your efforts in seeing him will make you to prosper regardless of the level of poverty affecting your life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 42 year old Nigerian lady who lives in America narrated her story with so much surprise and bewilderment about her ex- husband.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>According to the lady she called a Uber driver to pick her to her place of work, but the man looks like someone she knows right back in Nigeria. She couldn&#8217;t ask him any question because people may have the same semblance without being brothers or people from the same blood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She also suspected that the Uber driver was taking a glosstry look at her but he couldn&#8217;t ask her too. When she returned from America to Nigeria. She went straight to investigate the whereabout of the man in his place of abode , but nobody was able to give her his present place of living.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some of his friends gave her a frightening information that the man is death in an accident. While some said they don&#8217;t know his present place of living.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The frightening story didn&#8217;t go down well with her and she decided to seek for Spiritual investigation about his whereabout so that if he is actually death. This is because she had a child for him during their marriage. Beside,she wanted to make the confirmation as the contact no of the ex- husband in Nigeria is still with her, but all calls are not going. However, the suspected Uber driver number in America is also with her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She went to many prophets and pastors to know the true picture of the man who divorced her after given birth to him. Some prophesied the man is death , while others said he is still alive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The lady who was visibly worried was later introduced to Chief Dr Ohanu Spiritual temple, phone+2348088077395. WhatsApp+234 8088077395. Address No 43 college road Mgbidi Oru west along owerri-Onitsha Exp way, Imo state Nigeria. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As she got to the temple of the Spiritualist. The man told her that her ex- husband is not death but was arrested and imprisoned wrongly, but was later released. He further said he is seeing the man in foreign country. The Spiritualist revelation correlated with her purpose of visit. She told the Spiritualist that she met a man in America that looks exactly like her ex-husband. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She later went back to America and called the Uber driver to pick her. The man came and upon her interview she discoverd that the man was actually her ex-husband who left the shores of Nigeria to America after been victimized for an offense he didn&#8217;t committed. They both reunited in America as husband and wife.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chief Dr Ohanu is a Spiritualist with a different that deeply understand the deep things of the spirit. If you are still doubting the credibility and efficacy of the Spiritualist. why can&#8217;t you contact him for your problem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My name is Christina Adeoye from Abe-okuta in Ogun state.I am from a royal breed because I came from a royal family. I dated my boy friend for 3 years and when we were about to marry the unexpected happened. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately when we fixed a date for marriage. My husband suddenly fell sick and was hospitalized for two weeks. The Doctors didn&#8217;t understand his sickness because it was subject to change. They carried out general body diagnoses, but yet the Doctors can&#8217;t point to the type of illness and his health was deteriorating every day. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was jittery to see the situation of my husband in a very serious condition as well as the feelings of his parents. The Doctors later referred him to another hospital and having shown the previous test they became perplexed to attend to his situation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At this point he can only hear but can&#8217;t speak. I went for prayers and i was told a woman was behind his sickness. So pastors told me to carry out Spiritual sacrifice  to revive him, but all seems to be worsening his condition. I went to a friend and explained the nature of the sickness .He referred me to a spiritualist called Dr Philip Solution temple, phone 0907 693 3177. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because of the curiosity in me for his survival, I first located the address without contacting the Spiritualist because of skepticism . After i located the address i summoned courage to interact with the spiritualist about the condition of the sickness. He asked me to quickly go and bring him before it is too late. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I rushed to the hospital the following day and asked the Doctor to  discharged him after explaining to the parents. We took him to Dr Philip Solution temple. The Spiritualist battled the sickness for 3 days with the use of roots and herbs and my husband who could not speak for over 3 weeks started speaking with us. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the 7th day of his admission in the spiritual temple he was certified to be heal and hearty and discharged from the spiritual home. Thereafter we got married eventually. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the day of our marriage my  husband thanked me and his parents openly to stood by him despite his critical condition. I replied with joy and full of enthusiasm that season change, people change, but my love for you will remain the same regardless of any situation. Thanks to Dr Philip who has been an inspiration to re-candle my faith and love for my husband. Glory be to God.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My name is Edwin  Adebayo from Osun state. I started searching for job after my graduation in the university of Lagos as an Accountant. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I submitted application in various banks across the country, but unfortunately i couldn&#8217;t get a job. I saw an advert in the federal ministry of finance and quickly applied for it and i was subsequently called for interview. Few weeks later, a mail was sent to me and surprisingly it was an employment letter. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I called the phone quoted in the letter and was asked to resume work the following week. I happily went to Abuja and and started working as a civil servant in the ministry for a year and half. Unexpectedly the federal government ordered for screening of all civil servants from grade level 9  down because of some suspicious employment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was screened out on the basis of fake employment and was threatening to be arrested. I left for Lagos secretly. As I got to Lagos with no hope of survival. I started beggining from friends to make both end meet. I became an applicant in the labour market. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In my search for a new job. I was introduced to Dr Philip Mystic temple. phone 0907 693 3177. The Spiritualist took me to his temple and gave me what he called Miracles soap and oil. He told me that all my lost glory will be restored as soon as i use the Miracles soap and oil for a week. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I got home the following morning and started using it as instructed. Within a month i received a letter from an oil company that have interviewed me for over 5 years to resume work immediately. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At first I was not serious with the letter, but a call came in with regard to the letter about my employment. I went to the company the following week and started working as a public relation officer. Now my enemies who never expected me to bounce back were shocked the way i metamorphosed from joblessness to my new place of work. </p>
