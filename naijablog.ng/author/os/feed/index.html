<p>It has been over two months now when Nigeria government promise to increase Police salaries as demanded by #endsars protest.</p>



<p>The government, under president Muhammad Buhari, pledge total reform of Nigeria police force,  which includes increasing the salaries and improving the welfare of police personnel.</p>



<p>It seem that nothing has been done about the promised since the uprising youths has been quench through force, and undercover dialogue.</p>



<p>Recall that Nigerians youths had on October took to the street to demand an end to police brutality and extra judicial killing by special anti-robbery squad (SARS).</p>



<p>The protest that last for over two week highlighted the objective Nigerian government must meet before they can let peace reign.</p>



<p> The demands of the protesters had included increment in the salaries of police officers, which the government promised to address.</p>



<p>But about two months after, Omokoshaban learn in report by SaharaReporters, disclosed that a top source in the police force told the news media that nothing had been done by the government regarding the demands of the protesters to improve the welfare of police personnel.</p>



<p>The source, however, revealed that efforts were already in place to implement a new salary structure following a recent directive by the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, which he described as different from outright salary increment.</p>



<p>According to the source, the new structure is being prepared by the Integrated Payroll Personnel Information System (IPPIS).</p>



<p>He said, &#8220;The new salary structure that we have now was prepared by IPPIS. A police constable earns nothing less than N40, 000. Then, as regards the promises made so far after the #EndSARS saga, we’ve not seen anything.</p>



<p>&#8220;But we strongly believe that some things are in the pipeline. The IGP has gone round most of the states, which I’m aware of and he mentioned that the welfare packages of police officers were being looked into alongside the salary structure, starting from himself down to the least police constable. We are hoping that by January, we’ll see the difference in the salary structure.</p>



<p>&#8220;All these things involve some processes; we believe once they implement it, there will be some arrears. Let’s hope by January, we will see some changes.</p>



<p>&#8220;The IPPIS is to prepare the new salary structure for the police. We have MSS (Mechanised Salary Section), MSS, which used to be used for the police salary before IPPIS came. IPPIS and MSS are working hand in hand now.</p>



<p>&#8220;Actually, when IPPIS came, there were some deductions. I think it happened in other sectors too like in the military. There were some deductions but after that, some amounts of money were added to the salaries, maybe N2, 500 or so, I can’t even remember.&#8221;</p>



<p>The source dismissed claims that there was an increment in the salary of police officers, explaining that what happened was adjustment in salary.</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;There was a salary adjustment for police officers, not salary increment. There was a rumour at a time that the salaries of police personnel had been increased. There was no increment, it was an adjustment in salary structure that was done. They are two different things.</p>



<p>&#8220;There was adjustment in salary structure. In the ministry, they don’t have levels but we do; we have level 11 up to 17. There was an adjustment in that structure to suit what the Department of State Services is using; to balance it up, just like an equivalent.</p>



<p>&#8220;For a newly recruited Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), before now, they used to be on Level 8 but now, they are put on Level 9 due to that structure adjustment. Level 9 for unconfirmed ASP, level 10 for confirmed ASP, a Deputy Superintendent of Police is on Level 11, and a Superintendent of Police is on Level 12.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;There was an adjustment in the structure not salary increment. Though indirectly, once there is an adjustment in structure, your salary will also increase but the salary for that particular level remains. But once there is a minimum wage adjustment, the salary for that level will increase.&#8221;</p>

<p>The statement was release by &#8220;Dr ‘Femi Adeluyi<br>Technical Assistant (Information Technology) to the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Ali Pantami on 26th November, 2020.</p>



<p>The statement was in reaction to news report claiming he was summoned by the Nigerian Senate over his role on communication devices in national security.</p>



<p>The state read &#8220;The attention of the Honourable Minister of the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, FNCS, FBCS, FIIM, has been drawn to some newspaper articles which claimed that the Senate summoned him concerning the role of communication devices in national security.</p>



<p>Dr Pantami awaits the official invitation and would like to sincerely thank the Distinguished Senators for their concern and support towards improving national security. The Honourable Minister has supported security agencies in their statutory duty of protecting lives and property and this is why his first action after his appointment was to issue a directive that no improperly registered subscriber identification module (SIM) be allowed to remain on our networks. Based on the report submitted by the regulator (Nigerian Communications Commission) on the 26th of September 2019, there is currently no improperly registered SIM on our networks. In the event of evidence to the contrary, the Honourable Minister will sanction any individual or institution found wanting.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Dr Pantami wrote to all security agencies on the 14th of October 2019 asking them to collaborate with the Ministry by contacting us whenever a crime has been aided and abetted through the use of telecommunication devices. No request by security agencies for assistance in the identification of owners of SIMs used for crime has gone untreated. The Honourable Minister also submitted a detailed memorandum to the Senate Ad-hoc Committee on Nigerian Security Challenges on the 12th of February 2020. It contained details on policies developed by the Ministry to enhance security.</p>



<p>In a similar vein, the Honourable Minister has directed the NCC to ensure that they put modalities in place to tie the National Identify Number (NIN) to SIMs, as well as see to it that no unregistered SIMs are sold. He has also directed the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) to significantly scale up the number of monthly NIN registrations.</p>



<p>Moreover, Dr Pantami recently presented a Draft National Policy on Digital Identity for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) at the Federal Executive Council (FEC) which took place on the 11th of November, 2020. The memo was approved and will support in the provision of Digital IDs for Nigerians, thus assisting in the implementation of the Policy to tie NINs to SIMs.</p>



<p>The Honourable Minister wishes to assure the Distinguished Senators and Nigerians that the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy is committed to using technology to support the growth of our economy and the security of our nation. To this end, we look forward to collaborating with the Senate and security agencies in this regard.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Lagos State Government through the Ministry of Tourism Arts and Culture has revoked the license of Queens Park Event Centre, Oniru as the Lagos State Safety Commission also sealed the facility for contravening the COVID-19 protocols of the State.</p>



<p>The Commissioner for Tourism, Pharm. Uzamat Akinbile Yussuf said the step to withdraw the license was taken in the best interest of the State and implored other event centres and venue owners to comply with the Government&#8217;s laid down directives otherwise risk loosing their chances of doing business in Lagos. She reiterated that the fight against the virus can only be successful if we all follow the laid down public health and safety protocols.</p>



<p>The Director-General, Lagos State Safety Commission, Mr. Lanre Mojola said it became necessary to take such steps following an event that was held at the venue on the 26th of December that contravened all safety protocols laid down by the State. He also sounded a stern warning to all other event centers and venue owners that flout safety protocols in the State, that it is not business as usual. As such, they should either fall in line with the State&#8217;s protocols or risk losing their license to operate in the State. He further stated that the Commission has begun a legal process against some recalcitrant business owners who removed the government seal and continued operations.</p>



<p>He further stated that mass gatherings at restaurants, bars, cafes and public places without observing necessary safety guidelines will increase the spread of the virus and therefore urged the public to maintain and observe all the necessary safety precautions.</p>



<p>Finally, he sounded a note of warning to all Night Clubs, Bars and Lounges operating against the States established safety protocol, that the State maintains zero tolerance towards those that do not abide by the regulations. He maintained that people must take responsibility and urged all and sundry to co-operate with the government to effectively curtail the spread of the virus which is still very much with us.</p>

<p> Angry Mob has send 6 bandits to early grave in  Kaduna State. </p>



<p>Omkoahaban learn that the bandits were  killed on different location in Sanga and Lere local government areas of Kaduna State.</p>



<p>The angry mob lunch manhunt and descend on them after killing 2 people.</p>



<p>The state’s Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan said the security report presented to the Kaduna State Government on Friday December 25 and the operational feedback from security agents indicate that the bandits were killed by mob action. </p>



<p>The report read;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“On 24th December 2020 at Fadan Karshi in Sanga local government area, two bandits attacked a businessman and dispossessed him of money and other valuables. On receiving the distress call, the military and police set out to the location. However, on getting to the scene, some angry locals had already mobbed the bandits and burnt them to ashes.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Aruwan who disclosed that armed bandits opened fire on motorists plying the Aboro-Kafanchan Road on Thursday night, also revealed that in Lere LGA, security agencies reported that bandits from a neighbouring state who specialised in stealing livestock were also killed through mob action. The bandits were chased and overpowered at Domawa village where three of them met their end in the hands of a mob.</p>



<p>He said;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“The bullets hit one Richard Sabo who in the course of driving knocked down one of the bandits to death. Sadly, Mr. Sabo who suffered bullet wounds was confirmed dead at Gwantu General Hospital.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The commissioner also revealed that the Kaduna&nbsp;government had received a report of the killing of a commercial motorcyclist, Hudu Yahaya of Ungwan Nungu village of Sanga LGA, adding that he was beheaded by bandits who escaped with his motorcycle.</p>



<p>The statement added;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Gov.
