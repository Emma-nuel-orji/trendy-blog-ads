<ul><li><strong>A team of Chinese researchers looked at influenza viruses found in pigs from 2011 to 2018 and found a “G4” strain of H1N1 that has “all the essential hallmarks of a candidate pandemic virus. </strong></li></ul>



<p>A new flu virus found in Chinese pigs has become more infectious to humans and needs to be watched closely in case it becomes a potential “pandemic virus”, a study said, although experts said there is no imminent threat.</p>



<p><br />A team of Chinese researchers looked at influenza viruses found in pigs from 2011 to 2018 and found a “G4” strain of H1N1 that has “all the essential hallmarks of a candidate pandemic virus”, according to the paper, published by the U.S. journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).</p>



<p><br /><br />Pig farm workers also showed elevated levels of the virus in their blood, the authors said, adding that “close monitoring in human populations, especially the workers in the swine industry, should be urgently implemented.”</p>



<p>The study highlights the risks of viruses crossing the species barrier into humans, especially in densely populated regions in China, where millions live in close proximity to farms, breeding facilities, slaughterhouses and wet markets.</p>



<p><br /><br />The coronavirus that caused the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic is believed to have originated in horseshoe bats in southwest China, and could have spread to humans via a seafood market in Wuhan, where the virus was first identified.</p>



<p>The PNAS study said pigs are considered important “mixing vessels” for the generation of pandemic influenza viruses and called for “systematic surveillance” of the problem.</p>



<p><br /><br />China took action against an outbreak of avian H1N1 in 2009, restricting incoming flights from affected countries and putting tens of thousands of people into quarantine.</p>



<p><br />The new virus identified in the study is a recombination of the 2009 H1N1 variant and a once prevalent strain found in pigs.</p>



<p>But while it is capable of infecting humans, there is no imminent risk of a new pandemic, said Carl Bergstrom, a biologist at the University of Washington.</p>



<p><br />“There’s no evidence that G4 is circulating in humans, despite five years of extensive exposure,” he said on Twitter after the paper’s publication. “That’s the key context to keep in mind.”</p>

<p><br>Drama played out on Tuesday as some senators walked the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Mr Festus Keyamo, out of a meeting.</p>



<p><br>The lawmakers had invited Keyamo to give details of the Special Public Works Programme where 774,000 people would be recruited by the Federal Government under the National Directorate of Employment (NDE).</p>



<p><br>During the meeting which was held at the National Assembly in Abuja, members of the Senate and House of Representatives Joint Committee on Labour sought to find out the method of selection of a 20-man committee from each state for the programme.</p>



<p><br>However, a heated argument erupted between committee members and Keyamo over who should helm the programme which was to be domiciled under the NDE.</p>



<p><br>As the rowdy session ensued, the committee decided to go into a closed-door session to discuss the matter, but the minister refused, insisting that further discussions be held in the presence of journalists.</p>



<p><br>This enraged the lawmakers who told Keyamo to apologise to the committee, but he ignored them.</p>



<p><br>Thereafter, the minister was asked to leave the meeting since he refused to apologise to the committee members.</p>



<p><br>The lawmakers claimed that Keyamo has no right to direct the committee on how to conduct its proceedings.</p>



<p><br>This comes a day after the minister inaugurated a 20-man committee in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) by virtual means.</p>



<p><br>According to him, 1,000 persons would be selected from each of the 774 local government areas in the country to be engaged by the government in the Special Public Works Programme.</p>

<ul><li><strong>The Petition Is Against Inspector Abraham, Supol Ugowe and the Entire Police Officers Team at Ikeja, Lagos Division of the Inspector General of Police.</strong></li><li><strong>The Alleged Arrest Was Without Any Warrant And Neither Our Client nor Her Friend, Favour, Was Informed Of The Reasons For Their Arrest. </strong></li></ul>



<p><br />The IGP gave the order in a letter signed on his behalf by his Principal Staff Officer, DCP Idowu Owohunwa and addressed to the Deputy Inspector-General of Police, Force Criminal Investigation Department, Garki.</p>



<p><br>The IGP&#8217;s letter was sequel to a petition written by Seyitan&#8217;s lawyer, Ojoge, Omileye and Partners. In the IGP&#8217;s letter titled &#8220;Re: Petition Against Inspector Abraham, Supol Ugowe and the Entire Police Officers Team at Ikeja, Lagos Division of the Inspector General of Police, the IGP asked that the petition from Seyitan Babatayo&#8217;s lawyer be addressed.</p>



<p><br />The petition from Babatayo&#8217;s legal representative &#8211; Ojoge, Omileye and Partners allege that policemen attached to the Intelligence Response Team arrested<br />eyitan on the directive of D&#8217;Banj and detained her for over 24 hours.<br /></p>



<p><br />It was also alleged that they denied her access to her phone and her lawyers and she was subjected to intimidation and psychological torture by the policemen.</p>



<p><br />The petition read in part, &#8220;On Tuesday, June 16, 2020, our client was picked up alongside a friend, Favour, at her residence in Lagos by the officers of the lIkeja IGP IRT. </p>



<p><br>The arrest was without any warrant and neither our client nor her friend, Favour, was informed of the reasons for their arrest.</p>



<p><br />&#8220;According to our client, she was told to write a statement denying ever meeting with Mr. Oyebanjo (D&#8217;Banj) and to also state that she lied against the person of Mr. Oyebanjo. In actual fact, our client was about to write the statement which she believed would be a basis for her release when the counsel came in and stopped her from writing such a statement.</p>



<p><br />The counsel further informed the policemen that all actions to the alleged rape of our client in December 2018 by Mr. Oyebanjo have been transferred to the DIG FCID for a thorough investigation and that they need to stay the action.&#8221;</p>

<ul><li><strong>Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng, And Thomas Lane, Are Being Accused Of Aiding And Abetting In Floyd’s Death.</strong></li><li><strong>Prosecutors Disclosed That They Have Gathered About 8,000 Pieces Of Evidence And Continue To Gather More.</strong></li></ul>



<p>The four former Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd’s killing appeared before a judge on Monday, June 29, 2020.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/screenshot_20200630-1353555009362876505265786.png?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-56720" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p><br /><br />Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng, and Thomas Lane, who are accused of aiding and abetting in Floyd’s death, appeared before Judge Peter Cahill on Monday afternoon in a courtroom at the Hennepin County Jail in downtown Minneapolis.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/screenshot_20200630-135336162319803603963304.png?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-56721" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>They were accompanied by their defense attorneys.</p>



<p>As for Derek Chauvin, who is charged with 2nd-degree murder and 2nd-degree manslaughter in the case, he appeared via video monitor from the prison where he’s being held.</p>



<p>Prosecutors disclosed that they have gathered about 8,000 pieces of evidence and continue to gather more.</p>



<p>Thao’s attorney, Robert Matthew Paule, provided the following statement on Monday,</p>



<p>“I have not commented publically in any regard… I’ve done so out of respect for Mr. Floyd and his family, I’m going to continue to do that. The judge today issued an order telling the litigants, whom I’m one, that we’re not to comment on the evidence, what we see as the merits to the case, or a person’s guilt or innocence… so I’m not going to do that.”</p>



<p>He later added, “my condolences to Mr. Floyd and his family, the death of a loved one is a very sad thing even under the best of circumstances.”</p>



<p>District Judge Peter A. Cahill warned all parties to stop talking about the case publicly and threatened a gag order or a possible change in venue for the trials if heavy pre-trial publicity continues.</p>



<p>“The&nbsp;court&nbsp;is not going to be happy about hearing about the case in three areas: media, evidence and guilt or innocence,” Cahill said.</p>



<p>He asked Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank to use his influence to keep public officials silent, warning that if they continued to discuss it publicly, he likely would “have to pull (trials) out of Hennepin County and they need to be aware of that.”</p>



<p>Judge Cahill also stated he’s also awaiting motions on whether the defendants will be tried separately or together in a joint trial.<br /><br />The next court appearance for the ex-officers was set for September with a tentative trial date set for March 8, 2021.<br /><br />According to jail records, Chauvin, 44, and Thao, 34, have been in custody since their arrest, while Lane, 37, and Kueng, 26, were released on conditional bond.</p>

<ul><li><strong>The Profiling Robots Can Be Used For The Detection Of Security Threats And Possession Of Dangerous Items By Anybody on campus.</strong></li><li><strong>It Wasn&#8217;t Revealed Whether The Robots Are For Covid-19 Profiling Purposes, The Humanoid Robots Are Known To Have Such Abilities. </strong></li></ul>



<p>The University of Lagos, UNILAG has recently just received profiling Robots capable of detecting Covid-19 and for the purpose of enhancing studies from a technology company @ThePlatformCap. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/screenshot_20200630-1020594930091028691902566.png?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-56692" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p><br />This was disclosed by the university management via their Twitter handle on Monday, June 29.</p>



<p>It tweeted, “Today, UNILAG, Nigeria received a donation of some cloud-based intelligent humanoid robots, CRZR from @ThePlatformCap&#8221;. </p>



<p>While donating the robots to the university, the chairman @ThePlatformCap Dr. Akintoye Akindele stated that the donation of the robots was made in order to improve the learning experience in the university as a whole.”</p>



<p>The wonderful thing is that this is reportedly the first of its kind among universities in Africa.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/screenshot_20200630-0957097459264805603952786.png?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-56694" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p><br><br>Although the university did not reveal the robots are for Covid-19 profiling purposes, the humanoid robots are known to have such abilities.</p>



<p><br />They can Be Programmed to Identify Unwanted Items and check body temperature.</p>



<p><br />The robots are Interactive and can lead or direct someone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/screenshot_20200630-0957577787143508054374620.png?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-56695" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>Profiling robots can also be used for detection of security threats and possession of dangerous items by anybody on campus.</p>



<p><br />If effective, other universities may follow suit in acquiring the robots to help profile and detect Covid-19 positive persons by running checks on body temperature.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Prophet Babatunde Alfa is Standing Trial Before An Ondo State High Court In Akure, The State Capital Over The Mysterious Disappearance Of One-Year-Old Gold Kolawole From The Church’s Children Department Last Year.</strong></li></ul>



<p>The ongoing trial of the founder of the Sotitobire Praising Chapel, Prophet Babatunde Alfa resumed on Monday at the Ondo State High Court in the continuation of the defence opened by the prophet and the six other defendants.</p>



<p><br>During the trial, one of the witnesses, Dr. Richard Akinnagbe, told the court how his testimonies were torn three times by officials of the Department of State Security, DSS.</p>



<p><br>Prophet Alfa is standing trial before an Ondo State High Court in Akure, the state capital over the mysterious disappearance of one-year-old Gold Kolawole from the Church’s children department last year.</p>



<p>While testifying before the court during Examination-in-Chief by lead Defence Counsel, Olusola Oke, Akinnagbe told the court that he was detained for one day by the DSS when he visited the secret service agency’s Office to state what he knew about the case being in church on the day gold got missing.</p>



<p><br>He alleged that the DSS tore three statements that he wrote in their custody because it was not what they wanted him to write.</p>



<p><br>The witness also accused Gold’s mother of reluctance to involve the police when he advised her to do so as she insisted that her husband and his friends will look for the toddler.</p>



<p><br>But, the state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Adekola Olawoye while cross-examining Dr Akinnagbe described him as a meddlesome interloper in the case whose testimony contains lies.</p>



<p><br>Olawoye also tendered in court as an exhibit, the statement said to have been written in DSS custody by Akinnagbe and though there was opposition by the Defence, the court accepted it.</p>



<p><br>The trial was subsequently adjourned till Tuesday by Justice Olusegun Odusola.<br><br>After the adjournment of hearing till Tuesday, Mr. Olawoye expressed dissatisfaction with the pace of the defence saying it was affecting many other state issues.</p>



<p><br>But the spokesman of the defence team, Akinyemi Omoware assured that they will call all their witnesses between the timeframe allotted by the judge.</p>



<p><br>20 witnesses have been slated to give testimony for Prophet Alfa and 6 other defendants to absolve them of complicity in the disappearance of Gold.</p>
