<p>As a result of the planned protest by a group of women foundation over rising cases of killings and rape in the country, the Nigerian Government has deployed armed mobile policemen at the entry point of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.</p>



<p>The armed policemen were reportedly stationed at strategic locations along Kubwa-Abuja expressway. </p>



<p>Police water canon trucks were also sighted in different locations in the city center in the bid to disrupt the planned protest on Thursday. </p>



<p>Several groups have lamented on the deplorable security situation across the country, especially in the Northern part of the country, and have called on President Muhammadu Buhari to rise to his constitutional responsibility and end the killings.</p>



<p>The Nigerian Government has become intolerant of criticisms by stifling dissenting and stop protests against injustice and oppression from holding. <br> </p>

<p>Following the reopening of airports and commercial flights in the country, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has put strict restricting measures for non-travelers.</p>



<p>FAAN made this known on Wednesday as part of the new protocols for the restart of flights amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>



<p>Stating this on Twitter, “Non-travelling passengers will not be allowed into the Airport Terminal Buildings. </p>



<p>&#8220;People coming to pick up arriving passengers are advised to remain in their cars until passengers exit the gate. Stay safe.”</p>



<p>FAAN also urged travelers to wear face masks, maintain two metres distance and arrive at airports at least three hours before flights to ensure proper checks.</p>



<p>There is however, a ray of hope as the Nigerian airports which were shut in March by President Buhari, as part of efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, will soon be reopened.</p>

<p>Founder and owner of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, announce that the platform will allow its users to turn off political ads.</p>



<p>&#8220;Everyone wants to see politicians held accountable for what they say &#8211; and I know many people want us to moderate and remove more of their content. </p>



<p>&#8220;For those of you who&#8217;ve already made up your minds and just want the election to be over, we hear you &#8211; so we&#8217;re also introducing the ability to turn off seeing political ads.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll still remind you to vote,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>Zuckerberg also announced that Facebook will take steps to boost voter registration, voter turnout, and marginalised voices ahead of the 2020 presidential election, and that the platform&#8217;s aim is to help four million people register to vote.</p>



<p>Following the fuss over Trump&#8217;s posts on Twitter, Zuckerberg criticised Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey for the supposed incometence of his social media network.</p>



<p>&#8220;I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn&#8217;t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Dorsey responded in a tweet, saying: &#8220;We&#8217;ll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. </p>



<p>And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make.</p>



<p>&#8220;This does not make us an &#8216;arbiter of truth.&#8217; </p>



<p>&#8220;Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves. </p>



<p>&#8220;More transparency from us is critical so folks can clearly see the why behind our actions,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Zuckerberg added that he believes the best way to hold politicians accountable is through voting.</p>



<p>&#8220;I believe we should trust voters to make judgments for themselves. </p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I think we should maintain as open a platform as possible, accompanied by ambitious efforts to boost voter participation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. John Bolton, Trump&#8217;s former national security adviser, claims that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> &#8220;pleaded&#8221; with Chinese President <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/xi-jinping">Xi Jinping</a> to help him win re-election in 2020 by purchasing more US farming products. </p>



<p>The former national security adviser claims this in his new book set to be released next week.</p>



<p>At a one-on-one meeting at a multilateral summit in Japan in the summer of 2019, Mr Xi expressed his dissatisfaction with some critics of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/China">China</a>&nbsp;within the US.</p>



<p>Mr Bolton stated that Trump misinterpreted Xi&#8217;s frustration.</p>



<p>“Trump immediately assumed Xi meant the Democrats. Trump said approvingly that there was great hostility among the Democrats.</p>



<p>“He then, stunningly, turned the conversation to the coming US presidential election, alluding to China’s economic capability to affect the ongoing campaigns, pleading with Xi to ensure he’d win.</p>



<p>&#8220;He stressed the importance of farmers, and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome. I would print Trump’s exact words but the government’s prepublication review process has decided otherwise,” Mr. Bolton adds.</p>



<p>Mr Bolton&#8217;s description of Mr Trump&#8217;s and Mr Xi&#8217;s conversation, in his soon-to-be-released book, <em>The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir</em>, does not, however, outline a proposed quid pro quo between Mr Trump and China, whereas the Trump administration&#8217;s freeze on vital military assistance to Ukraine as it sought political favours was a central component of Democrats&#8217; impeachment of Mr Trump.</p>



<p>At a press conference earlier this week why he is trying to prevent the book’s publication, Mr Trump said he “wasn’t impressed” with Mr Bolton while he worked for the administration and that the book was “inappropriate.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Somebody said he went out and wrote a book. If he wrote a book, I can’t imagine that he can because that’s highly classified information. Even conversations with me, they’re highly classified. I told that to the attorney general before — I will consider every conversation with me as president highly classified,” Mr Trump said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, a group protested in Katsina, calling on Aminu Masari, the state governor, and President Muhammadu Buhari to resign over their inability to safeguard lives and properties of Nigerians in the North.</p>



<p>This group has asked the Nigeria Police Force to immediately release Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Coalition of Northern Groups, Mr Nastura Sharif, who is currently being <a href="http://saharareporters.com/2020/06/17/police-arrest-detain-organiser-protest-katsina">detained for leading a protest</a> against insecurity in Northern Nigeria. </p>



<p></p>



<p>Reacting to this development, the said Nigerian group, in a statement by its Convener, Deji Adeyanju, accused the Nigerian Government and police of being insensitive to the needs of the citizens. </p>



<p>Mr. Adeyanju stated “We are greatly worried that the President is arresting critics of his sheer incompetence in the handling of security situations in the North instead of the bandits killing Nigerians. </p>



<p>&#8220;The President should arrest the bandits and not patriotic citizens speaking up against the gross incompetence of the government. </p>



<p>&#8220;A government that negotiates and begs bandits cannot be arresting critics. </p>



<p>“The President needs to show leadership and stop arresting those criticizing him. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are in democracy and this system of government gives the citizens the right and freedom to hold elected public officials accountable. </p>



<p>&#8220;If the President can’t tolerate dissents, he should be courageous enough to resign. </p>



<p>&#8220;Freedom of assembly is one of the most fundamental rights of the citizens in a democracy.”</p>



<p>Adeyanju further stated, “We are solidly behind Nastura Sharif and we call on the Nigerian Government to release him immediately from detention.”</p>

<p>After the Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, said the COVID-19 herbal medicine had been handed over to three agencies for investigation, no date had been given to Nigerians as to when an official response would be given on the results. </p>



<p>According to the National Agency for Food, Drug Administration and Control, and the National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development, there have been no significant update.</p>



<p>“We are still working on it,” the DG of NAFDAC, Mojisola Adeyeye, stated clearly.</p>



<p>“I cannot give you an update but we are working on it,” she added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mrs Adeyeye had said in a television interview before the drug was sent to NAFDAC that it would take two weeks for the agency to determine if the drug was fit for purpose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apparently, these agencies are yet to come up with tangible results, and it has also be reported that the Madagascar herbal cure has been narrowly rejected.</p>

<p>Molly Kilete,&nbsp;<em>Abuja</em></p>



<p>The General Court Martial set up by the Army has tried Major General Hakeem Otiki and has found him guilty of stealing N400M. </p>



<p>The General Court Martial, headed by Lieutenant-General Lamidi Adeosun, found Otiki guilty on all the five counts charges filed against him. </p>



<p>The charges are for stealing N100 million and N160, respectively from the Nigerian army in count one and two. </p>



<p>Added to it was the disobedience to standing order under section 66 of the Armed Forces Act, on count there, four and five respectively. </p>



<p>The pronouncement is however subject to confirmation from the Army Council.</p>



<p>The Court which started at exactly 7:55 monday night and held at the army headquarters command officers Mess, Asokoro, pronounced the judgement at exactly 23:13 hours.</p>



<p>The GCM sentenced the former GOC to dismissal with disgrace and dishonor on count one, dismissal with disgrace on count two, reduction to the rank of brigadier General with two years seniority, severe reprimand on count four and two years loss of seniority on the rank of Major-General.</p>



<p>All the sentences are subject to approval by army council.</p>



<p>Otiki, an infantry officer was accused of stealing money allocated to the 8 Division Nigerian army Sokoto. </p>



<p>The said money which was supposed to be in the custody of the Finance Officer of the division was said to have been diverted by the senior officer who was also accused of engaging in private business other than the army job.</p>



<p>But the Defence counsel while appealing to the court for leniency on his client, said the accused had already returned the money which he was being charged for and that most of the projects he was accused of embarking on had been completed or are at various stages of completion</p>



<p>The Defence Council however, pleaded that the accused officer was due for retirement this year and that he is very sick and that his wife was down with cancer. </p>



<p>He said the officer lost his mother last July and is the bread winner of his family. </p>



<p>“For this reason we ask the court to temper justice with mercy,&#8221; he pleaded.</p>



<p>“By next month, which is July, the accused senior officer would have been in incarceration for almost one year. So we plead that your lordship look at the officer with compassion”. The Defence counsel pleaded with the court.</p>
