<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Egypt has plans to lure tourists back to the country and they want to achieve this by unveiling two new airports.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Monday, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi inaugurated two more airports near Cairo. This move is in a bid to lure tourists as Egypt, just as every other country needs to bounce back from the economic downturn caused by coronavirus.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the airports is situated in Egypt’s new administrative capital, about 50 kilometres (30 miles) to the east. The government hopes to turn it into a hub that reduces traffic in the sprawling 20-million strong megacity of Cairo.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The other airport known as Sphinx Airport is located in Giza, south of the capital.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is reported that the two airports will soon begin to handle flights from abroad, in addition to Cairo international airport. We can recall that the airport authorities announced the return of all commercial flights starting from 1st July.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The claim made by one John Okupurhe has it that the NPA has a secret Unity Bank account. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He further said that the account has a balance of $1bn. This violates the Federal Government’s Treasury Single Account policy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This claim came after Okupurhe demanded payment of commission on the allegedly exposed money from the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation in line with the Federal Government’s whistle-blowing policy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Earlier, Okupurhe wrote a letter to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). In the letter, he accused the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), of refusing to pay him his reward after exposing over $1bn hidden in the bank.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Okupurhe had said that he provided the office of the AGF with information about a cloned account with the NPA.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The account was reportedly being used to collect revenue illegally from vessels by the signatories who were no longer in the service of the NPA.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He said that the information he gave to the AGF “led to the exposure of the hidden/concealed funds in Unity Bank Plc to the tune of $1,034,515, 000.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The office of the AGF released a statement in response to Okupurhe’s claim. It said that the government only pays whistle-blowers, whose information lead to successful recovery of illicit funds and not for mere tracing or exposure of suspected illegitimate funds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the same vein, the Nigerian Ports Authority has denied the existence of any such account containing $1bn as alleged by Okupurhe on Monday.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>A soldier and his wife Sues the Nigerian Army</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-56600" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200630-WA0009-393x315.jpg?resize=393%2C315&#038;ssl=1" alt="See why the Nigerian Army was sued for arresting wife of soldier" width="393" height="315" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The Nigerian Army has been sued by a soldier and his wife.</p>
<p>The wife of a soldier, Mrs. Victoria Idakpini, and her husband, Lance Corporal Martins Idakpani, have sued the Nigerian Army, the Chief of Army Staff, and the Attorney-General of the Federation for breach of fundamental human rights.</p>
<p>Mrs. Idakpini was arrested last week barely days after her husband, Lance Corporal Idakpani, berated the Chief of Army Staff, Lt.Gen Tukur Buratai; and the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Gabriel Olonisakin, in a video which went viral on the Internet.</p>
<p>In the video, the soldier called on his superiors to resign as they had failed in the war against terrorism.</p>
<p>In the suit filed on their behalf by their lawyer, Mr. Tope Akinyode, the applicants are seeking an order to compel the respondents to release her immediately.</p>
<p>The couple, in a supporting affidavit deposed to on their behalf by one Apeh Abuchi, said that they had been denied access to a lawyer and had not been informed of the alleged crime they committed since their arrest last week.</p>
<p>In a signed statement on Monday, Akinyode, who is the National President, Revolutionary Lawyers’ Forum, described the continued detention as illegal.</p>
<p>The lawyer said in a statement,</p>
<p>“We have just filed an action at the Federal High Court against the Nigerian Army, Chief of Army Staff and the Attorney of the Federation of Nigeria over the unlawful arrest and detention of Lance Corporal Martins and his wife, Mrs Victoria Idakpini.</p>
<p>On June 23, 2020, the Nigerian Army arrested Lance Corporal Martins for being critical of the army chief of staff over the handling of security crises and lack of adequate amenities to battle terrorism.</p>
<p>We are of the considered view that the continued detention of Lance Corporal Martins violates his fundamental human rights much as it violates the extant provisions of the Armed Forces Act.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Army displayed a higher degree of despotism on June 25 when it illegally arrested and has continued to detain the wife of Lance Corporal Martins, Mrs Victoria Idakpini leaving her three children- twins of two-years-old and another who just clocked three – to the care of no one.”</p>

<p>News reaching us has it that President Buhari has approved the appointment of a Deputy Commissioner of Police, Aliyu  Musa, as his Chief Personal Security Officer.</p>
<p>The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, disclosed this in a statement on Monday.</p>
<p>According to the statement, Musa from Nigerian Police Force Zone 5, Benin City, as his last station, hails from Niger State.</p>
<p>“Musa’s appointment follows the redeployment of his predecessor, Commissioner of Police, Abdulkarim Dauda,” Shehu wrote.</p>
<p>Dauda is one of the security operatives redeployed from the Presidential Villa in the wake of the shooting incident that involved security aides attached to the President’s wife, Aisha.</p>
<p>Aisha and her aides had stormed the official residence of the President’s Personal Assistant, Sabiu Yusuf, in an attempt to force him into 14-day isolation after his travel to Lagos considered to be the epicentre of COVID-19 in Nigeria.</p>
<p>We learnt that Musa resumed work officially on Monday.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56586" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200629-WA0055.jpg?resize=447%2C293&#038;ssl=1" alt="COVID-19 : FCT seals hotel for operating night club" width="447" height="293" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Missouri hotel, located in the Maitama District of Abuja, has been sealed off on the orders of a mobile court on Monday.</p>
<p>This is for allegedly operating a nightclub during the curfew hours. The action, the court said, was in contravention of the COVID-19 protocols.</p>
<p>Handing down the order on Monday, Magistrate Idayat Akanni, directed that the hotel should be sealed for one week.</p>
<p>The court also sentenced 11 defaulters to three-day community service with an option of N5, 000 fine each.</p>
<p>We gathered that six of the defaulters are workers of the hotel, who were apprehended by the COVID-19 enforcement team for opening up their business within the curfew hours of 10pm to 6am within the FCT.</p>
<p>Five fun-seekers found on the premises were arrested for partaking in the social gathering, which according to the court constituted nightclub activities.</p>
<p>Speaking with newsmen, the prosecutor, Udeme Umanah, who is also the Chief State Counsel for the FCT, said the defaulters were convicted for operating a nightclub.</p>
<p>Chairman of the FCT Ministerial Task Force on COVID-19 restrictions, Ikharo Attah, who led his team to enforce the court order, said the arrest and trial of the defaulters followed the complaints from the residents of the area.</p>
<p>Attah said that security personnel visited the premises and discovered that the activities there were in contravention of COVID-19 guidelines, adding that the defaulters were arrested on Sunday.</p>
<p>He said,</p>
<p>“The hotel has been sealed up pending when the court decides otherwise in the next one week; until then, the place is to remain under lock and key.”</p>
