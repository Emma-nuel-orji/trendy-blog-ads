					<description><![CDATA[I am exposing the so called actress Grace Amah, who goes around social media talking about how she is such a Christian all this while she fell pregnant  with a man who was married and had a whole family in the UK. She keeps talking about how happily married they are, all this while he has other children with other women. She keeps bragging about how she gave birth in the uk all this while she came looking for this man and he denied the pregnancy. She stayed in the uk to give birth trying to convince this man to leave my sister and their child. His side chick also recently left and went to America (I won’t mention her name because she was unaware of this man relationship and she is unaware that we know about her and this man by the name of GBolagade Aiyegoro) pictures coming soon.]]></description>
