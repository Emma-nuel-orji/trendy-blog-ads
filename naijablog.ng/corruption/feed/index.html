<p>The Detained Binance Executive has dragged NSA, EFCC to Courtfor alleged violation of his fundamental human rights</p>



<p>The detained Binance executive, Tigran Gambaryan, has sued the National Security Adviser (NSA) Nuhu Ribadu, and the Economic Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over the alleged violation of his fundamental rights, Premium Times is reporting.<br>Mr Gambaryan, in the originating motion dated and filed 18 March by his lawyer, Olujoke Aliyu, from Aluko and Oyebode Law Firm, sought five reliefs before Justice Inyang Ekwo. Also, Nadeem Anjarwalla, Binance’s Africa regional manager who escaped from lawful custody on 22 March, filed a separate right enforcement suit before Justice Ekwo.</p>



<p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Messrs Gambaryan and Anjarwalla, in the suits marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/356/24 and FHC/ABJ/CS/355/24, had sued the Office of NSA (ONSA) and EFCC as 1st and 2nd respondents.<br />They sought the same reliefs.</p>



<p>Mr Gambaryan, a US citizen overseeing financial crime compliance at the crypto exchange platform, in his application, sought a declaration that his detention and seizure of his international travel passport contravened Section 35 (1) and (4) of the Nigerian Constitution.</p>



<p>He said the act amounted to a violation of his fundamental right to personal liberty as guaranteed by the Constitution. He also sought an order directing the respondents to release him from their custody and return his international travel passport with immediate effect.</p>

<p>The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Thursday, March 14, 2024 dragged former Kogi State governor, Yahaya Adoza Bello before Justice James Omotosho of the Federal High Court, Maitama, Abuja for alleged N84billion money laundering offences, alongside his nephew Ali Bello, Dauda Sulaiman and Abdulsalam Hudu.</p>



<p>The EFCC is prosecuting the quartet on an amended 17-count charge of money laundering, breach of trust and misappropriation of fund to tune of N84, 062,406,089.88 (Eighty-four Billion, Sixty-two Million, Four Hundred and Six Thousand, Eighty-nine Naira, Eighty-eight Kobo).</p>



<p>To make way for Yahaya Bello’s inclusion in the trial, prosecution counsel Rotimi Oyedepo, SAN, informed the court of an application before it for the amendment of the charges against the defendants, dated February 5, 2024, and filed the same day. He then prayed that the amended charges be read to the defendants for them to take their pleas. The judge granted the prayer, overruling objections from A.M Aliyu SAN, and Olusegun Joolawo SAN, counsels to Ali Bello and Suleiman, first and second defendants.</p>



<p>Count one of the charges reads: “That you, Ali Bello, Dauda Suleiman, Yahaya Adoza Bello (still at large) and Abdulsalam Hudu (still at large), sometime in September, 2015 in Abuja, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, conspired amongst yourselves to convert the total sum of N80,246,470,089.88 (Eighty Billion, Two Hundred and Forty-six Million, Four Hundred and Seventy Thousand, Eighty-nine Naira, Eighty-eight Kobo), which sum you reasonably ought to have known forms part of the proceeds of your unlawful activity to wit: criminal breach of trust and you thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 18(b) and punishable under Section 15(3) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011 as amended.”</p>



<p>While ex-Governor Yahaya Bello and Hudu are still at large, Ali Bello and Suleiman, first and second defendants respectively, who were present in court “pleaded not guilty” to all the charges when they were read to them.</p>



<p>In continuation of the trial, Oyedepo invited fourth Prosecution Witness, PW4, Yakubu Gana, counsel to the property owner and seller of a property located in Danube Street, Maitama, Abuja which Ali Bello and Suleiman allegedly bought at the cost of N950million on behalf of ex-governor Yahaya Bello through their lawyer, Ramalan Jibril Abdullahi.</p>



<p>Gana said that, “we negotiated and agreed on the sum of N950million. Their lawyer, Ramalan Abdullahi, said his clients would prefer to pay in cash and in dollars. I had to call my client to inform him because he was not in the country at that time. My client cautioned me whether I knew the buyers, and I answered I knew their lawyer way back in secondary school.</p>



<p>“The lawyer and the clients invited me into their office, a bureau de change office at Zone 4, adjacent to Sheraton, now Abuja Continental Hotel. They then showed me dollars in ‘Ghana must go,’ but the dollars in ‘Ghana must go’ was not up to that N950million. They said they would make it up by bringing some dollars to make it to N950million. The transaction took us almost two weeks, and the lawyer invited me to the same BDC office for confirmation, then the money was completed in dollar equivalent,” he said.</p>



<p>In his testimony as fifth prosecution witness, Abdullahi told the court that though he acted as a go-between in the purchase of the property, his major assignment was to carry out due diligence on the said property which paved the way for its purchase by Ali Bello and Suleiman, his clients.</p>



<p>Oyedepo requested for the property’s title documents to enable him to tender them in evidence. However, Justice Omotosho ordered him to formally apply to the defendants and thereafter adjourned the matter to March 28, 2024 for continuation of trial.</p>

<p>The Chairman of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ola Olukoyede, has called for legislation against unexplained wealth, as a way of checking the criminal activities of treasury looters in the country.</p>



<p>Speaking at a recent event in Ogun State, he said: ”The issue of unexplained wealth is not a local issue. There are jurisdictional legislations across the world to tackle it.</p>



<p>Till date, countries of the world are faced with criminalities emanating from money laundering practices and illicit funds. This circumstance led to the promulgation of Unexplained Wealth Orders, UWOs that came into force in 2018.</p>



<p>Several countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Mauritius and African countries like Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean have come up with UWO. Nigeria is yet to come up with a national legislation on it.</p>



<p>In Nigeria today, unexplained wealth has become practical means of tracing, identifying, investigating and prosecuting corr¥ption cases.</p>



<p>As an anti-graft agency, suspects of any economic and financial crimes are usually required to declare their assets in the course of investigation. The basis for this is to properly establish their true asset base and their linkage or otherwise to any act of corruption.</p>



<p>Owing to the absence of legislation on the issue of unexplained wealth, the EFCC continues to rely on provisions of Section 7 of its Establishment Act to handle it.</p>



<p>Nations are rapidly settling for non-conviction-based asset forfeiture. The reason for this is simple because unexplained wealth can only be beneficial to the state if they are forfeited</p>

<p>The Economic and Financial Crime Commission, EFCC, has arraigned Salisu Suleiman, managing director of Faris Construction Company Limited and his company on one-count charge of misappropriation of funds to the tune of N21,000,000 (Twenty One Million Naira) only.</p>



<p>He was arraigned on Tuesday, December 12, 2023 before Justice Hadiza Suleiman of the Kano State High Court sitting in Kano.</p>



<p>The lone count charge reads: “That you, Salisu Suleiman being the Managing Director of Faris Construction Company Limited and Faris Construction Company Limited on or about 15th June 2021 in Kano, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court dishonestly misappropriated the sum of N21,000,000 being payment for the supply of 125,000 litres of Automotive Gas Oil , AGO, to your construction site in Nguru Local Government, Yobe State by SID Oil and Gas Limited and you thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 308 of the Penal Code Law and punishable under Section 309 of the same law.”</p>



<p>He pleaded not guilty to the charge when it was read to him, prompting prosecution<br />counsel, Aisha Tahar Habib to pray the court for a trial date, while the defence counsel, Mardiyya Alasan Dawaki applied for his bail. Habib opposed the prayer of the defence counsel on the ground that the defendant had jumped<br />an administrative bail earlier granted him by the EFCC.</p>



<p>Justice Suleiman remanded the defendant in EFCC’s custody and adjourned for hearing on the bail application.</p>



<p>Suleiman allegedly received 125,000 litres of Automotive Gas Oil, diesel, on credit from the petitioner, S.I.D Oil and Gas Limited worth N21,000,000 (Twenty One Million Naira) on the ground that he will pay upon receipt of payment from Yobe State Government for the supply.</p>



<p>He, however, breached the promise after the Yobe State Government had paid him, preferring to lie to the defendant that he had received no payment from the state government. The petitioner suspected foul play and petitioned the EFCC. Investigations revealed that the defendant had been paid by the Yobe State Government a long time ago, but misappropriated and diverted the money entirely for his personal use.</p>

<p>President Muhammadu Buhari has urged the west western countries to return assets stolen by past corrupt leaders as well as artefacts taken away by British colonialists.</p>



<p>Speaking on Thursday, October 6, in an opinion article published in the Financial Times of London titled ‘The West must return Africa’s stolen assets, as well as its artefacts,’ the president said that only a fraction of Nigeria&#8217;s looted funds has been recovered.</p>



<p>According to him, “Nigerians were delighted by the news this summer that 72 artefacts, known as the Benin Bronzes, held by the Horniman Museum in London were returning home, 125 years after being plundered by British troops. The clamour for repatriation of looted treasures is becoming irresistible.</p>



<p>There was once a similar clamour for the return of Africa’s stolen assets, and I see both as part of the same struggle to bring back to Nigeria what is rightfully ours. Siphoned from the continent by corrupt former leaders, countless billions remain stashed in western bank accounts. Although Nigeria has arguably been the most successful among African nations in securing the return of stolen money, it has recovered only a fraction of what remains in the west.</p>



<p>Given levels of corruption across Africa, there will be concern as to whether funds returned will be used appropriately. But we should not forget that it was through western jurisdictions that the money was laundered in the first place. Not trusting Africans to spend their own money properly echoes the argument that we can’t be trusted to look after our own cultural heritage.</p>



<p>Museums say that treasures should be returned if it can be proved that they were looted. Of course, they argue, it is a different matter if artefacts were acquired through purchases and other legitimate means. But it is the same museums that are responsible for assessing the provenance of artefacts. They have a vested interest in keeping them, encouraging a lackadaisical approach and murky criteria.”</p>
