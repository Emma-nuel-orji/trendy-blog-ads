<p>Nigerian bodybuilder dies after being shot by his wife during a disagreement in the U.S.</p>



<p>A US-based Nigerian bodybuilder, Michael Chidozie, has died weeks after his wife shot him multiple times at their apartment in Houston, Texas.</p>



<p>The 26-year-old died last week after his wife Keaiirra Shavoiyae Chidozie, 28, shot him four times in front of their kids in their home on March 21, 2024.</p>



<p>DailyMail reports that the deceased was rushed to Ben Taub Hospital after police found him with gunshot wounds and his wife in a panic holding their two kids, aged three and two.</p>



<p>Chidozie lingered on life support as his family prayed for his recovery, but he suffered a devastating spinal injury and di£d of complications 18 days later.</p>



<p>According to the report, Keaiirra was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after the shooting, and her charges have not been upgraded since his death.</p>



<p>She claimed to have shot Chidozie in self-defense as she feared for her life during the argument when he followed her into their bedroom. It’s unclear what the argument was over.</p>



<p>The argument began elsewhere in the house before she went to the bedroom, where she picked up a pistol and shot him.</p>



<p>Chidozie was shot once in the arm, once in the chest, and twice in his torso and left to di£ on the bedroom floor.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Keaiirra was released on bail and is set to next face court on May 23. Their children are being cared for by other family.</p>

<p>A 22-year-old lady, Fasia Ajoke, was on Thursday sentenced to seven months and three weeks in prison by the Special Offences Court at Bolade-Oshodi for assaulting a Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps female officer while on duty.</p>



<p>The state Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Tokunbo Wahab, disclosed this in a post on his X handle on Thursday.</p>



<p>Wahab said Ajoke was also guilty of resisting arrest and refusing to use the pedestrian bridge.</p>



<p>His post read, &#8220;The Special Offences Court at Bolade-Oshodi today convicted a lady, 22-year-old Fasia Ajoke to seven months and three weeks in jail for assaulting a female operative of the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps (KAI) #LAGESCOfficial on lawful duty, resisting lawful arrest and refusing to make use of the Ile-Epo pedestrian bridge, thereby endangering her life in the process.</p>



<p>&#8220;She was arraigned before Chief Magistrate S.A Adefioye of the Lagos State Special Offences (Mobile Court), Bolade-Oshodi on offences bordering on conducting herself in a manner likely to breach peace, obstruction and breach of peace by crossing the highway.&#8221;</p>



<p>The commissioner urged residents to desist from assaulting environmental officers and to prioritise using pedestrian bridges.</p>



<p>He wrote, &#8220;We enjoin every well-meaning Lagosians to desist from assaulting our environmental officers and also make use of the pedestrian bridges as the state will not hesitate to prosecute anyone found breaking the law.&#8221;</p>



<p>The PUNCH reported on Tuesday that the Lagos State Government arrested seven miscreants for allegedly assaulting environmental officials during the removal of shanties and illegal structures along the Jakande Estate in the state.</p>



<p>It had also reported in February that the government described the crossing of major highways in the state by pedestrians as an offence adding that any defaulter caught will be prosecuted.</p>

<p>The details of the arrest was share on army Facebook social media page.</p>



<p>The statements signed by Ayeni read:</p>



<p>&#8220;Headquarters 81 Division Nigerian Army (NA) has successfully apprehended nine individuals who have been masquerading as soldiers of the NA and engaging in criminal activities that disrupt the peace and security enjoyed in Lagos State and its environs.</p>



<p>The impostors who were paraded to the media 13 March 2024 at Headquarters 81 Division NA, Victoria Island Lagos were identified as, Mr. Abua Jacob, Mr. Solomon Abraham, Mr. Mohammed Jemilu, Mr. Michael Omieh, Mr. Dauda Samuel, Mr. Bida Musa, Miss Esther Audu, and Miss Vivian Titus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="678" height="451" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17104337579535662288224375070019.jpg?resize=678%2C451&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-145667" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17104337579535662288224375070019.jpg?w=721&amp;ssl=1 721w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17104337579535662288224375070019.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>These suspects have been arrested for various offenses, including illegal duties, providing illegal security, and illegal escort services while donning military uniforms. Their actions have not only compromised the safety of civilians but also tarnished the esteemed image of the Nigerian Army.</p>



<p>Mr. Abua Jacob, a dismissed soldier, was apprehended on February 7, 2024, at Alaba International Market, Ojo Lagos, for impersonation. Mr. Solomon Abraham, Mr. Michael Omieh, Mr. Mohammed Jemilu, and Mr. Dauda Samuel, all dismissed soldiers, were also arrested in separate incidents for similar offences. Additionally, Miss Esther Audu and Miss Vivian Titus were arrested for impersonation during operations along various routes in Lagos.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17104337609716401407109834872691.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-145668" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17104337609716401407109834872691.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17104337609716401407109834872691.jpg?w=721&amp;ssl=1 721w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>The General Officer Commanding 81 Division NA, Major General Mohammed Takuti Usman, has urged law-abiding citizens in Lagos and6 Ogun States to remain vigilant and report suspicious activities. He reassured the public that concerted efforts, in collaboration with other security agencies, will continue to ensure that such criminal elements are denied a comfort zone within the Division&#8217;s Area of Responsibility.</p>



<p>The suspects will be handed over to the Nigerian Police for further investigation and prosecution in accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>



<p>The Nigerian Army remains resolute in its commitment to ensuring the safety and security of citizens within its jurisdiction and will continue to take decisive action against individuals impersonating service personnel and other criminal elements.</p>

<p>A man, Joshua Williams, 23 has been charged with strangling a 15-year-old girl in the South Shore neighborhood in Chicago.</p>



<p>According to CBS News, he’s charged with first-degree murder in the death of Amarise Parker. Police said Williams strangled Parker on Tuesday, December 12, 2023, in the 7200 block of South Phillips Avenue. Her body was found in the building around 7:24 p.m. the same day.</p>



<p>Prosecutors said Williams and Parker had been in a dating relationship, and her family had filed several missing persons reports when she would leave home. It is reported that Parker had been staying with the suspect for several days before the murder.</p>



<p>On Sunday, December 10, she went to the home of a neighbor of Williams, and asked to use the phone to call her mother to get picked up. When her mother went to Williams&#8217; home to pick her up, she couldn&#8217;t find Parker, who called her again the next morning asking to be picked up, prosecutors said.</p>



<p>This time, when Parker&#8217;s mother went to pick her up, she got in her mother&#8217;s car and went home with her, and told her mother Williams would not let her leave. Parker told her mother she escaped when Williams thought she was in the bathroom. When Parker&#8217;s mother left their apartment that day to pick up her other daughter from school, she returned home to find Parker gone.</p>



<p>Prosecutors said Parker had returned to Williams&#8217; home on Monday, December 11, and stayed overnight. Neighbors heard them arguing that night, and around 7 p.m. on Dec. 12, Williams called his cousin and a friend and told them Williams was foaming at the mouth, and he didn&#8217;t know what to do. </p>

<p>This was made known in a statement signed by the Director of Media and Advocacy, Femi Babafemi, shared on the agency’s page on Sunday.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="169" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824531954.jpg?resize=300%2C169&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-144362" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824531954.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824531954.jpg?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1 678w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824531954.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>The statement disclosed that the property was used as a clandestine laboratory for producing methamphetamine by a convicted drug baron, Okenwa Chris Nzewi.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824534461.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-144363" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824534461.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824534461.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>Following Nzewi&#8217;s conviction, the mansion, along with his vehicle marked EKY 496 DJ, has been forfeited to the Federal Government.</p>



<p>Nzewi, arrested with associate Sunny Okeh Ukah, had pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four and three years imprisonment, respectively.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824536932.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-144364" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824536932.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824536932.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>The statement in part said, “Okenwa was arrested along with his associate, Sunny Okeh Ukah on 30th July 2022 and subsequently arraigned on four counts in charge number FHC/L/527C/2022 at the Federal High Court, Lagos. They both pleaded guilty on 17th July 2023, while they were convicted and sentenced to four and three years imprisonment each with an option of fine of four million (N4,000,000) naira and three million (N3,000,000) naira respectively in addition to community service for four and three weeks each. His vehicle marked EKY 496 DJ was equally forfeited to the Federal Government.</p>

<p>“To further deny him of enjoying the proceeds of his criminal activity, the NDLEA filed a civil forfeiture charge against the building used as a clandestine laboratory at the Federal High Court Lagos which initially granted an interim forfeiture order that elapsed on 6th December before the final forfeiture on 7th December 2023.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, NDLEA operatives in Lagos on Friday 15th December arrested a 75-year-old grandma, Mrs. Sekinat Soremekun for dealing in illicit drugs. At the time of her arrest in the Oshodi area of Lagos, quantities of cannabis and litres of codeine syrup were recovered from her. She claimed her son, Segun who is now at large supplied her the illicit substances which she retailed.”</p>
