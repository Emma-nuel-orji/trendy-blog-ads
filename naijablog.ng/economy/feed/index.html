<p>-Declares a final dividend of 60kobo per share</p>



<p>Lagos, Nigeria, April 16, 2024: Leading financial institution, Fidelity Bank Plc, has released its 2023 full year Audited Financial Statements, reporting a 131.5% growth in Profit Before Tax to N 124,26 billion.</p>



<p>According to the results, which was issued to the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) today, the bank grew Gross Earnings by 64.9% YoY to N555.83 billion, driven by 81.6% growth in Net interest income which increased from N152.7billion to N277.37 billion. This led to a Profit After Tax of N99.45 billion representing a 112.9% annual growth.</p>



<p>Commenting on the Bank’s commendable performance, Dr. Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe,OON, MD/CEO of Fidelity Bank Plc said, “We closed the financial year with strong double-digit growth across key income and balance-sheet lines. Our performance in 2023 is an attestation of our capacity to deliver superior returns to shareholders despite the difficulties in our operating environment. Profit before tax grew by 131.5% to N124.3bn from N53.7bn in 2022FY, leading to an increase in Return on Average Equity (RoAE) of 26.5% from 15.6% in 2022FY.”</p>



<p>A review of the financial performance showed that the bank grew Net interest income by 81.6% to N277.4bn driven by a 55.5% increase in interest income, thus reflecting a steady rise in asset yield throughout the year. The average funding cost dropped by 20bps to 4.4% due to increased low-cost funds that grew from 83.6% in 2022FY to 97.4% in 2023. The combination of higher asset yield and lower funding cost led to an increase in Net Interest Margin (NIM) of 8.1% from 6.3% in 2022FY.</p>



<p>Similarly, Total Customer Deposits crossed the N4tn mark as deposits grew by 55.6% from N2.6tn in 2022FY. The increase was driven by 81.1% growth in low-cost funds.</p>



<p>Despite the challenging operating environment, the bank reaffirmed its devotion to helping individuals grow, inspiring businesses to thrive and empowering economies to prosper by increasing Net Loans &amp; Advances to N3.1tn from N2.1tn in 2022FY.</p>



<p>Despite the growth in its loan portfolio, Regulatory Ratios were maintained well above the required thresholds, with liquidity ratio at 45.3% from 39.6% in 2022FY and capital adequacy ratio (CAR) at 16.2% compared to the minimum requirement of 15.0%.</p>



<p>“We recognize the changing dynamics in the Nigerian banking space and the need to monitor and proactively manage evolving risks. The proposed final dividend of 60 kobo per share reflects our commitment to strong value creation and returns to our shareholders,” explained Onyeali-Ikpe.</p>



<p>Fidelity Bank has consistently paid dividend since 2006. With the proposed final dividend of 60 kobo per share, Fidelity Bank would be paying investors a total dividend of 85 kobo per share for the reporting period, a 70.0% increase compared to the 50 kobo per share paid to its shareholders in the previous year.</p>



<p>Ranked as one of the best banks in Nigeria, Fidelity Bank is a full-fledged customer commercial bank with over 8.3 million customers serviced across its 251 business offices in Nigeria and the United Kingdom as well as on digital banking channels.</p>



<p>The bank has won multiple local and international awards including the Export Finance Bank of the Year at the 2023 BusinessDay Banks and Other Financial Institutions (BAFI) Awards, the Best Payment Solution Provider Nigeria 2023 and Best SME Bank Nigeria 2022 by the Global Banking and Finance Awards; Best Bank for SMEs in Nigeria by the Euromoney Awards for Excellence 2023; and Best Domestic Private Bank in Nigeria by the Euromoney Global Private Banking Awards 2023.</p>

<p>Conversion Strategy: How To Make Money From Old House in Nigeria by Dennis Isong</p>



<p>Nigeria has experienced a surge in real estate development over the years,and with conversion properties emerging as a lucrative investment avenue. The conversion of existing structures into alternative uses presents a unique opportunity for investors to capitalize on the evolving landscape of the Nigerian real estate market. In this article, we delve into the concept of conversion properties in Nigeria and explore the financial benefits associated with this innovative investment strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conversion properties involve the transformation of existing structures for purposes other than their original design or use. In Nigeria, this can encompass repurposing commercial spaces into residential units, renovating old warehouses into trendy office spaces, or adapting heritage buildings for modern purposes. This adaptive reuse not only adds value to the property but also contributes to sustainable urban development.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">FINANCIAL BENEFITS OF CONVERSION PROPERTIES IN NIGERIA:</h1>



<ul>
<li>Cost-Effectiveness:</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversion properties often come with cost advantages compared to ground-up developments. Renovating an existing structure is typically more cost-effective than constructing a new building. This cost efficiency allows investors to allocate resources strategically and potentially increase profit margins.</p>



<ul>
<li>Faster Returns on Investment (ROI):</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversion process is generally quicker than starting a project from scratch. With less time spent on obtaining permits and navigating regulatory hurdles, investors can realize returns on their investment faster. This speedier ROI is particularly attractive in a dynamic market like Nigeria&#8217;s, where trends can change rapidly.</p>



<ul>
<li>Diversification of Portfolio:</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including conversion properties in an investment portfolio offers diversification benefits. Investors can balance their risk exposure by incorporating different types of real estate assets. The diversity inherent in conversion properties allows investors to tap into multiple market segments, creating a resilient investment portfolio.</p>



<ul>
<li>Meeting Changing Demands:</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigeria&#8217;s evolving demographics and urbanization trends have led to changing demands for real estate. Conversion properties provide a flexible solution to meet these changing needs. By repurposing existing structures, investors can align their investments with current market demands, ensuring sustained relevance and profitability.</p>



<ul>
<li>Contributing to Sustainable Development:</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repurposing existing structures aligns with sustainable development goals. Investors in conversion properties can benefit from positive public perception and government incentives aimed at promoting environmentally conscious practices. This alignment with sustainability principles can enhance the long-term value and marketability of the property.</p>



<ul>
<li>Enhanced Value and Appeal:</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well-executed conversion projects have the potential to enhance the aesthetic and functional appeal of a property. This increased value can translate into higher rental or resale prices, maximizing the financial returns for investors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF CONVERSION PROPERTIES&nbsp;</h2>



<p>1. Regulatory Compliance:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Navigating regulatory requirements can be challenging, given the diversity of Nigerian states and local authorities. Investors must thoroughly understand and comply with zoning laws, building codes, and other regulations to avoid delays and potential legal issues.</p>



<p>2. Market Research and Due Diligence:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conducting thorough market research and due diligence is essential for identifying viable conversion opportunities. Understanding local market trends, demand dynamics, and competition will help investors make informed decisions and mitigate risks associated with potential oversaturation or changing market conditions.</p>



<p>3. Infrastructure and Accessibility:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing the existing infrastructure and accessibility of a property is crucial for its success. Investors should consider the availability of essential services, transportation links, and the overall infrastructure to ensure the property&#8217;s attractiveness to potential tenants or buyers.</p>



<p>4. Financing Challenges:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While conversion projects can be cost-effective, securing financing may still pose challenges. Investors should explore various financing options, including partnerships, loans, and government incentives, to ensure sufficient capital for successful project completion.</p>



<p>5. Adaptability to Market Trends:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real estate market is dynamic, and trends can shift rapidly. Investors in conversion properties must stay attuned to market changes and be prepared to adapt their projects to align with emerging demands and preferences.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CASE STUDIES AND SUCCESS STORIES</h2>



<p>Examining successful conversion projects in Nigeria can provide valuable insights and inspiration for prospective investors. Learning from the experiences of others can help identify best practices, potential pitfalls, and innovative approaches to maximize the financial benefits of conversion properties.</p>



<p>Residential Conversions:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transforming underutilized commercial spaces into modern residential units has gained popularity in Nigeria&#8217;s urban centers. Successful projects have demonstrated the potential for higher rental yields and increased property values in response to the growing demand for contemporary living spaces.</p>



<p>Office Space Revitalization:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Converting outdated office buildings into vibrant coworking spaces or tech hubs has proven successful in attracting innovative businesses. This adaptive reuse not only revitalizes the property but also contributes to the development of dynamic, collaborative work environments.</p>



<p>Heritage Building Preservation:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repurposing historic buildings for commercial or cultural uses has become a trend in preserving Nigeria&#8217;s architectural heritage. Investors engaging in such projects often benefit from government incentives, positive public perception, and the unique charm associated with historic properties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Lagos State, Nigeria, is a bustling metropolis known for its vibrant culture and economic opportunities. As the population continues to grow, so does the need for housing and infrastructure development. However, before embarking on any construction project in Lagos, it is crucial to understand and adhere to the building approval requirements set forth by the Lagos State government. This article will outline the key prerequisites and steps to obtain building approval in Lagos State.</p>



<p>1. Land Ownership and Title Documentation</p>



<p>The first step in obtaining building approval in Lagos is to establish clear ownership of the land on which you intend to construct. You must possess a genuine land title document such as a Certificate of Occupancy (C of O), Deed of Assignment, or Governor&#8217;s Consent. Without proper land ownership documentation, you cannot proceed with the approval process.</p>



<p>2. Architectural and Engineering Designs</p>



<p>Once land ownership is confirmed, the next step is to engage the services of a registered architect and structural engineer. They will be responsible for creating detailed architectural and engineering designs that adhere to the Lagos State Urban and Regional Planning Law. These designs must also comply with zoning regulations, building codes, and other relevant standards.</p>



<p>3. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)</p>



<p>For certain projects, an Environmental Impact Assessment may be required. This assessment is necessary for developments that have the potential to affect the environment significantly. An EIA report must be submitted to the Lagos State Ministry of Environment for evaluation and approval.</p>



<p>4. Submission of Building Plan Approval Application</p>



<p>With your architectural and engineering designs in hand, you can proceed to submit your building plan approval application to the Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority (LASPPPA) or the local government planning authority, depending on the location of your project. This application should include the following:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211; Completed application forms</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211; Architectural and engineering drawings</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211; Environmental Impact Assessment report (if applicable)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211; Evidence of land ownership</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211; Tax clearance certificates</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211; Site photographs</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211; Other relevant documents as requested</p>



<p>5. Assessment and Approval Process</p>



<p>The Lagos State authorities will review your application to ensure compliance with building codes, safety standards, and land use regulations. The assessment process may involve site inspections, interviews with the project team, and a thorough evaluation of the submitted documents. Once your application is approved, you will receive a Building Plan Approval Permit.</p>



<p>6. Payment of Statutory Fees</p>



<p>Before commencing construction, you are required to pay the necessary fees and levies to the Lagos State government. These fees include development and planning permit fees, foundation fees, and other applicable charges.</p>



<p>7. Commencement of Construction</p>



<p>Once you have obtained your Building Plan Approval Permit and paid the required fees, you can start construction. It is crucial to adhere strictly to the approved plans and timelines to avoid any legal issues in the future.</p>



<p>8. Regular Inspection and Compliance</p>



<p>Throughout the construction process, the Lagos State authorities may conduct periodic inspections to ensure that the project complies with approved plans and safety standards. Any deviations or violations can lead to project stoppage or penalties.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say I give you a book titled &#8220;How to drive&#8221; and you read it.</p>



<p>Does it mean you know how to drive?<br />What you have is knowledge of driving.</p>



<p>Until you get into a car and start driving, you actually don&#8217;t know how to drive.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s my process about learning as an individual and a business owner,<br />I don&#8217;t read everything to store information in my head.</p>



<p>I learn a few things at a time, and practice the hell out of them.</p>



<p>I read two chapters of Akin Alabi&#8217;s book &#8220;How to sell to NIGERIANS&#8221; and I stopped.</p>



<p>I spent the next two weeks practicing how to create offers to sell bottled water which is normal sold at N100, for N1000.<br />And I don&#8217;t sell bottled water.<br />Then I continued.</p>



<p>Last year, I took Chioma Ifeanyi-Eze course on how to create Ebooks. I stopped at Video 3 or so. For the 12 days, I practiced creating hot captions and titles.<br />Then I continued.</p>



<p>I sat down with Emeka Nobis to create a strategy to sell UNSACKABLE in September 2021.</p>



<p>I practiced and used the strategies we created, and I&#8217;m still practicing and using, till today..</p>



<p>The secret is simple.<br />LEARN SMALL.<br />PRACTICE BIG.</p>

<p>Omokri words read; </p>



<p>When you were in university, and your lecturer had to share handouts, but they were not enough, he simply made photocopies from the one he had. Is that not so? Learn from that. When you have money, but it is not sufficient, make photocopies of your money. A business is a money photocopier. An investment is a money photocopier. An asset, such as a house you can rent, is a money photocopier. Stop consuming your original. Photocopy it and consume the photocopies. Invest your earned income. That is your capital. Spend your dividends. Those are your disposable income.&#8221;</p>

<p>If you ask anyone that has bought or hoping to buy land in Lagos about their obstacles in buying such land, they would tell you about the fear of an encounter with omo-onile. Some people have vowed never to buy in Lagos again because of the bitter experience with these people. No matter where you hope to buy land in Lagos, you are highly likely to have an encounter with them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who then are the omo-oniles?</h2>



<p>Omo-oniles are people who claim ownership of land. A land can belong to a family, someone sells it and gives you its papers. Then, other members of the family get wind of it and instead of fighting the seller, they decide to harass you. And if care is not taken, you may end up paying for and multiple times because they just keep showing up.</p>



<p>Omo-onile are not calm people you can take with leniency. They can be a big bone in your throat. You have to stand firm and serious if you don’t want your land property taken away from you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Buying land is not that simple -it involves a lot. This omo-onile may sell to multiple people, thereby causing serious trouble. And if you are not the type that likes while you may end up leaving that land out of frustration.</p>



<p>Alhaji Dauda, for the past 6 years is still having issues with them. Alhaji is a very tough man and the more they give him troubles, the more he is bent on not leaving the land. It even got to the point of going diabolical, yet, he didn’t budge.</p>



<p>One thing about other mo-online groups is that prevention is better than cure. Avoid them as much as you can and how you do this, I will highlight them in this article.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. You need a property Lawyer</h2>



<p>Not all Lawyers can handle this for you, that’s why you need a Lawyer who specializes in property Law. He/she will be able to handle it properly based on professionalism and experience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Go to the site with the land surveyor and your lawyer</h2>



<p>A land surveyor should:</p>



<p>-Read the coordinate of the plot with his GPS (Global Positioning System) and other instruments</p>



<p>-Compare the coordinate readings with the ones in the land survey if there is a copy already.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If it corresponds, then your lawyer/agent should go to Alausa with a copy to find out if the land is under Government acquisition or not. The response from Alausa will determine if you should move to the next stage or not.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Your Lawyer sees to proper paperwork</h2>



<p>These papers are important to be properly done:</p>



<p>-The land surveys</p>



<p>-Deeds of Assignment</p>



<p>-Land receipt</p>



<p>-Certificate of Occupancy&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>-Government consent should be prepared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When an omo-onile sees a Lawyer who knows her onion, they are hesitant to mess up, so they comply level-headed. Your Lawyer will organize a meeting between you and representatives of omo-one and all families involved in the said land transaction and make sure they append their signatures for proper documentation. You can go ahead with developing your land because after all these are achieved, it means that your property is safe.</p>



<p>4. Your Lawyer comes in again by negotiating a settlement with the omo-one of that neighborhood.</p>



<p>Each stage of development might involve the interference of omo-onile. That is why your Lawyer should meet them for negotiation before you start development at all just to avoid waste of materials because they could beat and harass your workers on site and that’s entirely a major issue.</p>



<p>&nbsp;If the news spreads, site workers may be unwilling to work on your site even if it’s all settled. Now, another issue is that if anyone is killed or maimed in the process of chaos, this issue might drain you for years because definitely, it will end up in court.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, you should also put into consideration the “Community Development Association.” You don’t want to keep having issues with these people because having so much trouble with them may end up extending your project to the stage of getting tempted to abandon it. so, it’s advisable that your Lawyer meets them ahead and discusses and negotiates a settlement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once this is done and the original receipt is given, you don’t have any problem going forward. Then your project will certainly move on smoothly without any interference/ disruption and will be completed within the stipulated time frame.</p>

<p>Not everyone buys a property to live in. Some buy strictly for business when they envisage a kind of prospect with such property.</p>



<p>Property conversion is not new and has been in existence for a very long time. People convert the property to anything that suits their interests or commercial needs.</p>



<p>One of these conversions is buying a property that was once residential and converted to a hotel. The hospitality business is one of the most lucrative businesses just a few people can dive into because it’s capital intensive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Converting a residential property into a hotel is not an activity that should happen on impulse. It should be thought through because there are circumstances it’s being surrounded with, most especially because the property wasn’t initially made for commercial purpose, how much more a hotel.</p>



<p>How can you know you are making the right decision?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1 . Does the community have more learned people?</h2>



<p>There’s a big problem with having a property in a community where just a few percentages are learned. It will stifle anything commercial you want to set up there, especially for businesses like hotels, bars, clubs, etc. A larger percentage of people in the community have to understand and find your business good enough for the place. If you are thinking of having a hotel in a community full of religious fanatics, you may end up being frustrated as you are likely to have people unnecessarily harassing your customers.</p>



<p>People go to the hotel for various businesses but you can’t convince a religious fanatic that it’s beyond coming to have sex which isn’t anyone’s business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You would do yourself a favor by avoiding such a community if your purpose is to convert a property bought into a hotel.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2 . Does the location bustle with activities?</h2>



<p>These can be divided into two. It’s either your commercial property is in the heart of the city or close to the heart of the city.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your business is more likely to thrive if it meets up with either of the two. Location is important in all businesses and not just any kind of location. Having a quiet, serene, and less crowded environment is good but may not be for your business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I once lived in an area and never knew a hotel existed (which had been there for a long time) until someone mentioned it. I had to check the description out because I never thought a hospitality business would operate there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in essence, not all locations are good for the hospitality business.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3 . What kind of hotel?</h2>



<p>This part talks about the size of the property. A standard hotel needs at least 6 plots of land. Does the property fulfill this land size? If not, then, you are building a motel or guest house. You need to consider a lot, such as parking space, bars, pool, etc. if the property you are about to buy does not have enough space, you might want to consider something lesser than a hotel.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4 . Does the area have something similar and thriving?</h2>



<p>&nbsp;I would urge that before making a final decision on conversion, you should find out or check if a similar business exists, how acceptable it is, how long has it been there, and how much it has survived. These answers will be a pointer to what you need to know and areas to improve when you build and establish yours.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5 . How motorable is it?</h2>



<p>Buying a property and converting it to an area that does not have a good road channel is a disaster. Firstly, it’s important to note that such property should be closer to the main road for easy access. Then, the linking roads should be good enough for cars to drive easily to your investment property. Distance and clumsy roads could be a big turn-off to guests, they would rather find someplace better.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6 . Security</h2>



<p>An investment like the hotel is open to all forms of danger. Numerous people are allowed in and you may never really know who is who. Meanwhile, you should prioritize your guests’ safety. To save yourself the stress of having to deal with insecurity, find out about how well fit their security is in the community, then also create your security after establishment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7 . Ensure commercial activities are worth it</h2>



<p>This is important. Ask questions to know if any businesses are to thrive there. Some places are so dry that it is difficult for any business owner to make money from their businesses. If the property you want to convert is located in such a community, do yourself a favor by not bothering to spend so much to put that kind of investment there.</p>



<p>Property conversion is a great idea only if it fulfills the requirements mentioned above.</p>
