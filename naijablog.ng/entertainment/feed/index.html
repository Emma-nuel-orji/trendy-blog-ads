<p>Nigerian comedian, basket mouth speak on how he feel when they accused wizkid of being proud.</p>



<p>In his explanation, </p>



<p>“All these talks about Wizkid being proud will always be funny to me. 2014 I had my show in Lagos and I really needed Wizkid to perform and I was willing to pay him anything.</p>



<p>I contacted him and he told not to bother about paying him. He promised to come as a surprise guest &amp; put up a show for free.</p>



<p>3 days to the event, Wizkid called me that he won’t be able to show up coz a very important family emergency had happened. I was really heartbroken but I just had to accept the reality. 35 minutes after that call, Wizkid asked me to contact any Nigerian artiste I will like to book for the event and get back to him with the bills. I quickly contacted Lil Kesh, Kcee, Yemi Alade and Phyno. The bill was about 40 Million Naira and Wizkid cleared it all. Mannn! I thought I was dreaming. Wizkid is not the guy social media keeps trying to make y’all believe he is” ~ Basket Mouth.</p>

<p>The Senegalis born American singer, popular known as Akon has say he doesn&#8217;t do drugs nor smoke.</p>



<p>In circular that has gone viral on social media, Akon didn&#8217;t only says he doesn&#8217;t involved in drugs and smoking, but also praise himself as the only rapper in the whole music business that doesn&#8217;t smoke, drink, or do drugs.</p>



<p>Part of his words read:</p>



<p>&#8220;I get dizzy when someone smokes near me, like I just hate it. I once tried to wrap a blunt, but my dad snéâked behind me and whîppéd me so if I&#8217;m not smôkîng today, it&#8217;s all thanks to my dad, I decided to never smôké. Growing up, I was never pressed by péer pressure. You couldn&#8217;t make me do what I knew wasn&#8217;t right. It couldn&#8217;t just happen because I always sort to uphold all the morals my dad thought me.&#8221; Akon</p>



<p>Truth be told, a lot of people do funny things which they know are wrong just because they can&#8217;t resist péer pressure. Friends will tell you things like, &#8220;Grow up, one time won&#8217;t hurt,&#8221; and you&#8217;ll go ahead to do it knowing fully well that it isn&#8217;t right.</p>



<p>Many people have gone astray because they&#8217;re not living but existing and letting people decide their lives for them. In all you do, live a moral life because you aren&#8217;t here to impress people for everything you do. You shall bear the consequences alone</p>

<p>When I first met my husband, I didn’t know he was singing because me I already said I cannot marry a singer. I didn’t know he was singing, I think he was even a fan,” Simi said.</p>

<p>Diaz and her business partner Katherine Power were guests on the Lipstick on the Rim with Molly Sims’ podcast in which she voiced her opinion on married couples sleeping in separate bedrooms.</p>



<p>“We should normalize separate bedrooms,” she shared. She said some couples might need two different houses. To me, I would literally, I have my house, you have yours. We have the family house in the middle. I will go and sleep in my room. You go sleep in your room. I’m fine.”</p>



<p>She added, “And we have the bedroom in the middle that we can convene in for our, you know, relations.”</p>



<p>As Power and host Molly Sims laughed, Diaz clarified that she used to believe separate rooms would be a great idea for her marriage before she said “I do” to Madden. “By the way, I don’t feel that way now because my husband is so wonderful. I said that before I got married,” she explained.</p>
