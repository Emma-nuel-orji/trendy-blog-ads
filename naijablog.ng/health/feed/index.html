<p>President Bola Tinubu, on Tuesday, said his administration was prioritising and improving Nigeria’s health sector through massive investments and an increased allocation of funds to the sector in the proposed 2024 budget.</p>



<p>He, therefore, appealed to Nigerian health workers practising abroad to “sacrifice their time to come back home and serve their people.”</p>



<p>This was as he implored countries poaching Nigerian health workers to consider the interest of Nigeria.</p>



<p>Tinubu made the call on Tuesday at the unveiling of Nigeria’s Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative at the State House, Abuja.</p>

<p>The Adamawa State College of Nursing and Midwifery has suspended the admissions it started on Tuesday after some Muslims in the state protested against the payment of parts of the admission fees in a microfinance bank owned by a church.</p>



<p>The school had directed applicants to pay the sum of N500 professional fee meant for the state Nursing and Midwifery Council into an account opened in the Brethren Microfinance Bank in Yola, the state capital, where the school is also located.</p>



<p>All applicants must also pay N5,715 for the admission form. The payment for the admission form was to be paid in other banks.</p>



<p>But some Muslims, led by one Shehu Ismail, protested the school management’s decision to use the church’s bank to collect the Nursing and Midwifery Council fee.</p>



<p>The group claimed the payment would increase the bank’s financial strength.</p>



<p>Besides, they said the school’s decision to use the bank smacked off “a gradual Christianisation of the state structures”.</p>

<p>Land of Hope sends 150 hospital beds from Denmark to Nigeria.</p>



<p>Nigeria’s healthcare system has totally collapsed and Land of Hope wants to lead the way and rebuild a system that is supposed to save lives.</p>



<p>Herning hospital has closed down because one of Denmark’s new super-hospitals is ready to open in Western Denmark. The vision behind the new hospital is to create a modern hospital that is capable of truly world-class therapeutic and operational efficiency.</p>



<p>Thanks to Region Midtjylland Land of Hope was selected to receive hospital beds and medical equipment from the closed down hospital.</p>



<p>When Land of Hope was selected I contacted DSV &#8211; Global Transport and Logistics Denmark for support.</p>



<p>DSV Denmark has supported Land of Hope for many years and I was so excited when they said yes to ship 150 hospital beds for free all the way from Denmark to Nigeria.</p>



<p>To load 150 hospital beds in two gigantic containers is not easy and again I was overwhelmed with the news that Bop Scan Office ApS offered to support Land of Hope with manpower to make sure all 150 hospital beds were packed into the container and they got support from Mesterflyt <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Yesterday the first container was packed with 75 hospital beds and today the second container will be loaded with the rest of the hospital beds. I´m on my way to the hospital now…… More pictures and videos coming up.</p>



<p>Please help me send BIG thanks to:<br />Region Midtjylland<br />DSV &#8211; Global Transport and Logistics Denmark<br />Bop Scan Office ApS<br />Mesterflyt</p>



<p>For taking part in rebuilding Nigeria´s healtcare system.</p>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says a rare case of monkeypox, with links to Nigeria, has been confirmed in England.</p>



<p>In a statement on Saturday, May 7, the agency said the patient who has been diagnosed with monkeypox had recently arrived in the UK from Nigeria, and is being treated at the infectious disease isolation unit of Guy’s and St. Thomas’ Hospital in Central London.</p>



<p>“As a precautionary measure, UKHSA experts are working closely with NHS colleagues and will be contacting people who might have been in close contact with the individual to provide information and health advice.</p>



<p>This includes contacting a number of passengers who travelled in close proximity to the patient on the same flight to the UK. People without symptoms are not considered infectious but, as a precaution, those who have been in close proximity are being contacted to ensure that if they do become unwell they can be treated quickly,” the statement reads.</p>
