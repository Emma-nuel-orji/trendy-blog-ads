<p>The affected tenant, Ifeanyichukwu Eluu, who&#8217;s a Pastor shared his experience online. He wrote:</p>



<p>“The last experience I had, getting an apartment in Anambra state wasn&#8217;t a good one. I had paid 100% for the apartment to the caretaker, preparing to settle in after signing the necessary tenancy agreement the following day.</p>



<p>&#8220;But there was a reconsideration afterwards, we had stayed for a longer time in a hotel. So, we needed to quickly move into the property, of which we informed the caretaker about the move. We rushed to get the basic things to equip the house right away and the same evening, we moved into the house.</p>



<p>&#8220;Around 12 midnight, I saw an alert of the exact Money I paid to the caretaker. I called him right away, he said the landlord refunded the Money when he heard we&#8217;re from Ebonyi state,&#8221; Abakaliki&#8221; as generally refered.</p>



<p>&#8220;I felt so insulted, embarrassed, as well, very concerned at such level of discrimination against fellow brothers.</p>



<p>&#8220;The last place I finally got a house, the Man asked where I&#8217;m from, I told him &#8220;Afikpo&#8221;. Then he said, okay, I know Afikpo, they are partly Abia state, I can consider you, that&#8217;s how we settled. But I wasn&#8217;t happy that I had to route through such bias just to get a house to live in</p>



<p>&#8220;Please, let the concerned handlers review this in time, hence the maxim &#8220;Igbo bu ofu&#8221;.</p>

<p>Reality TV star, actress and model, Beverly Osu, has bewailed the rate at which infidelity has been normalized in relationships and marriages today.</p>



<p>In a recent chat with Vanguard Newspaper, the 30-year-old thespian while speaking on why she’s still single, said this generation has made relationships look cumbersome with the way they cheat on their spouses.</p>



<p>According to her, she’s not cut out for such relationships which explains why she’s not in a serious relationship at the moment. She however stated that she’s open to love if she meets a good partner. She said, “This generation is making love look so hard with cheating here and there. These days, cheating is now a norm. For me, I can’t. Maybe because I am old school but I can’t.</p>



<p>I just want to love and have a companion. But so far, I am so single. I think this is the longest that I have been single. And I am open to love. The next man I date, I am going to expose him on social media so that I will know the fate of the relationship early enough. Maybe he is dating over 5 girls in this Lagos, you never can tell.”</p>



<p>On why she’s not married, Beverly said, “If dem come marry me, I go go naw. Sincerely, there was a time I used dream about weddings. I see my wedding dress but now I don’t see anything. I just want to live and of course pray to God that I don’t breed children out of wedlock because I want to be under a family. A unit. I always say this to my friends and family, I am not emotionally strong to be a baby mama. I can’t do it all by myself.</p>



<p>I know I have supportive system; I have friends, I have family that would be there. But I can’t do that. In a case where it happens, then the child would be in his father’s house. I know they say when you have the child, then you know better, but I tell you, if that happens the child will be in his or her father’s house. That’s why I want to try my best to do it the right way; marriage. And I love love. I want to be in love and obsessed with my family; my partner. We give birth and breed the child together.”</p>

<p>The photo has generated mixed reactions on Facebook, with some criticising the poster and the women for drinking alcohol while wearing &#8216;church uniform&#8217;.</p>



<p>A Facebook user identified as Lubem Terkula posted a photo of some women spotted drinking beer at a joint in Benue State.</p>



<p>It was gathered that the women are members of a Christian women&#8217;s organisation in the state.</p>



<p>The photo has generated mixed reactions on Facebook, with some criticising the poster and the women for drinking alcohol while wearing &#8216;church uniform&#8217;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nobody stop them to drink but at least they should have respect the uniform they are putting on,&#8221; one Uba Shima wrote. &#8220;That uniform is meant for church activities not beer parlour activities,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wrong posting those women here i dont just know what you are turning into. Is it wrong for them to have a relax time at your place,if eventually their husband nor people of same Organization saw this,do you no the damages that will caused thereafter. Don&#8217;t be doing something like one who doesnt reason,&#8221;</p>



<p>Another Facebook user said: &#8220;Even those who forbids it still take it, just drink responsibly. Take one or two is okay.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 37 year old man from Ogun state narrated how live goat was used to remold his destiny for success and favour within a year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The man who was said to have been suffering from abject poverty as a result of hatred and helplessness bounced back to a very wealthy man in the society has this to say.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have nothing and nobody seems to help me. I was dejected and rejected in the past. So this made me to look for a Spiritualist who can help me to make money out of the blue. According to him he has spent every kobo that came to his pocket searching for a true spiritualist who will put smile into his face in the length and breath of the country, but could not find a genuine one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He became tired and unperturbed about what life has in stock for him. Little did he know that there are Spiritualists who can make him rich and wealthy through Spiritual means, but they are not common in the country.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was subsequently introduced to Chief Dr Faraji Voodoo temple, phone+23407019357444. WhatsApp+23407019357444. The moment he got to the Spiritualist . He became so furious thinking the man was similar to others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Surprisingly, Chief Dr Faraji told him to get a live goat and some Spiritual items for the money ritual and the work have to be done naked in the broad daylight at the three junction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He accepted to buy the materials unwillingly because of the condition attached to the work. As someone desirous of getting money by all means. He decided to give it a trial after pondering about it for some minutes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He went to the market and bought all necessary items and the spiritual work was carried out at the three junction in the afternoon. He there after came back to his house and money started coming from all his engagements. Unmerited Favour from different people across the state.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Within a space of a year. He became excessively rich and wealthy. Those within the community started calling him names and it was extended to other parts of the LG by backbiters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When he heard this through a brother. He decided to declare how he makes his money </p>
<p>in the churches and public places. He took the steps to disabused the minds of people who believe the accusations in the social media as well. He was full of happiness to blow it open without hiding any secret .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In case you are interested or worried about the claim . You may contact Chief Dr Faraji for the veracity of what makes me who i am today. Your financial freedom will embarrass your enemies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The love of money among the youth and the elderly in Nigeria has made a yahoo boy to remote control a German lady to Nigeria with charm.</p>
<p>The yahoo boy who uses charm to get money from his unsuspecting clients before remote controlled the German lady to Nigeria because of his numerous unsuccessful attempt visit to Germany.</p>
<p>When the lady arrived in Nigeria the yahoo boy received her in the Nnamdi Azikwe Air port and went straight to hotel room which he booked to accommodate her. After having a pleasant bed rest over the night.</p>
<p>The Yahoo boy who wanted to go to Germany with the lady left her in the hotel room and went to see his Spiritualist called CHIEF DR FARAJI VOODOO TEMPLE. He explained his initial intention to the Spiritualist with what he intends to do now. His immediate plan is to use her for ritual, but his Spiritualist advised him not to do so.</p>
<p>The Spiritualist after consulting the ancestors told him to perfect arrangements with her and travel to Germany instead wasting her life. He was confused and didn&#8217;t know what to do. The Spiritualist gave him love ring for attraction and favour.</p>
<p>The yahoo went back to the hotel room and discussed the matter with the German lady. The boy approached her for marriage and how best she can help him to stay with her in Germany.</p>
<p>The German lady was so happy and excited to hear this from a Nigerian boy friend because the story about Nigeria were all negative. She called German embassy and move to Nigeria embassy to perfect the traveling documents of her boy friend.</p>
<p>They came back to the hotel with full of joy visibly shown in their faces. Within a week both of them travelled to Germany and settled down as husband and wife.</p>
<p>The Yahoo boy was regarded as citizen because of marriage. He got a lucrative job through his wife and stayed with her for 5 years. Having spent such time together with her. He told her one day that he want to go back to Nigeria and see his parents, but promised that he will come back within two weeks.</p>
<p>He solicited for permission from his place of work and travel back to Nigeria. Upon his arrival he decided to pay a visit of appreciation to his Spiritualist who made him to be a change agent. The former yahoo boy has become a big man within the short period of time spent in Germany.</p>
<p>Infact, when he got to the Spiritualist. It was a merry making day because the guy bought a lot of drinks, food and every one around there drank to stupor. He appreciated the Spiritualist for changing his life from being a perpetual yahoo boy in Nigeria to a German citizen.</p>
<p>He explained some of his experiences while in Nigeria as a yahoo boy with limited freedom due to the security agents that were after them.</p>
<p>He therefore admonished the youth in Nigeria to channel their brain and energy for something that will last long and beneficial to them and the society at large instead of dabbling into a risky business that their parents cannot enjoy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">He travelled back to Germany to rejoin his wife after seeing his parents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 38 year old man from Abe-okuta in Ogun state narrated how he over come the attack of the enemies using a protection ring.</p>
<p>The man who was subject to Spiritual attack said . Enemies started attacking him when he was in the womb according to his mother. His mother was at her last leg in the process of delivery owing to his destiny that has been for seen by the enemies.</p>
<p>Immediately he was delivered. Sickness from nowhere nearly cost his life, but was rescued from the plan of the enemies by a renowned prophet Obadiah Adeyemi now late.</p>
<p>The incessant attack by the enemies continue and unabated in my life and i decided to seek for a protection for my self as a grown up man at my 30 years of age. I ran to some acclaimed powerful herbalist to wash the hands of enemies away from my body, but all efforts proved abortive.</p>
<p>When i explained this to a friend he referred me to a prophet believe to be powerful for the protection of people from attack. I got to the prophet and he prophesied that an enemy from within the house hold of my father was responsible for the series of Spiritual attacks in my life. He asked me to embark on 7 days white fasting and prayer which i did without wasting time. The attacks were ceased for a while and returned in a more difficult form.</p>
<p>I became confused on what to do in order to stop Spiritual attack in my life. I started looking for a Spiritualist who can help me to defeat my enemies in all ramifications. I was introduced to Chief Dr Faraji Voodoo temple, phone (ZERO SEVEN ZERO, NINETEEN, THIRTY-FIVE, SEVENTHY-FOUR, FOURTY-FOUR)</p>
<p>Infact I have not seen such an anointed Spiritualist who at first sight unfolded the history of my life beginning from the day i was born to day. There after he now asked me my purpose of visiting him. It was then,I attest to his prophesis over my life.</p>
<p>I told him my situation and needed a spiritual solution. The Spiritualist gave me a protection ring which i always wear in my left hand . As soon as i put the ring i felt something within me that a some thing left me.</p>
<p>However, the Spiritualist told me that any one trying to attack me spiritually shall face the consequences. As i got home one of my siblings who has been very nice to me said she have tried always in connivance with others to kill me through Spiritual attack, but they were always defeated.</p>
<p>But something stroke her mind to tell me immediately she set her eyes on me. According to her she saw a mighty angel in front of me who pointed a sword to her face threatened her to confess, otherwise she will die. Those behind the attack was also exposed and they all confessed their sins against God.</p>
<p>All glory and honor to the Almighty for using Chief Dr Faraji to save my life from further Spiritual attack.</p>
<p>In case you are facing Spiritual attack of any kind. You may contact Chief Dr Faraji for Spiritual embalment against attack.</p>
