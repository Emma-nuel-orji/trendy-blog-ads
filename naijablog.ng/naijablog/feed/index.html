<p>UNVEILING THE TRUTH AND EXPOSING THE LIES</p>



<p>Did Chioma Egodi Review Erisco’s Nagiko Tomato Mix or Was She On A Mission To Destroy Erisco Foods And Run It Out Of Business?</p>



<p>Be The Judge</p>



<p>On September 17th, 2023, Chioma Egodi Jnr in a facebook post on her timeline made the following statement;</p>



<p>“I went to but (buy) Tin Tomatoes yesterday that I will use to make stew, I didn’t see Gino and Sonia, so I decided to buy this one, (referring to Erisco Nagiko tomato mix), I decided to taste it omo! Sugar is juat (just) too much! Haaa biko let me know if you have used this Tin tomato before because this is an ike gwuru situation!”</p>



<p>The said post generated lots of reactions from her followers and facebook users; below are some of the reactions:</p>



<p>One Blessing Okeke responded “Stop spoiling my brother’s product, if you don’t like it use another one than bring it on social media or call the customer service of Erisco Foods Ltd”</p>



<p>Chioma Egodi Jnr, responded to Blessing Okeke by writing “help me advise your brother to stop ki***ing (killing) people with his product, yesterday was my first time of using and its pure sugar. Tueh!</p>



<p>Lets look at that response in a proper perspective. Is that response still product review or product destruction? She just alleged that Erisco’s product is killing people. This is a very serious allegation and where and how did she get the information that the product is killing people?</p>



<p>(is this a product review?). Be the judge</p>



<p>More so, One Amaka Love Amaobi responded by writing “my sister thanks for updating us Dalu nne”</p>



<p>(now based on Chioma Egodi allegation, this person will never use Erisco’s products again and moreso, through the word-of-mouth advert which is the most effective form of advert, she will spread this allegation to multiples of people)</p>



<p>One Don Kashking responded: Pls can we now spoil the product? And Chioma replied him by stating “done already bro,…</p>



<p>The above statement is a clear conspiracy from Chioma Egodi and syndicate to destroy, damage and wreck the brand, Ersico. They have moved from product review to product destruction.</p>



<p>Apart from the comments above, there were many more comments suggesting that the Erisco Nagiko Mix is a bad product and people should avoid it.</p>



<p>Interestingly, there were many positive reviews from some of the users of the products, who gave positive reviews of the products and blatantly condemned what Chioma Egodi was doing. They cautioned Chioma Egodi that what she was doing was not a review but deliberate act to destroy Erisco Foods and it&#8217;s products.</p>



<p>Chioma responded to them by the write up below;</p>



<p>@followers about my post yesterday concerning the sugary Tin Tomatoes, my inbox has seen a lot ooo, pls help me tell these persons to avoid me. I only ask if anybody has used it to give their honest opinion but these people is attacking me on my inbox that I am spoiling business for their brother, pls it’s enough stop it. We can take this matter to court oo if you want.</p>



<p>You can see that Chioma was the first person that talked about going to court.</p>



<p>So, why the outcry now that the matter is in court?</p>



<p>Furthermore, an interesting observation from the conversations on the comments section of her post is that she abused those that had positive comments about Erisco Nagiko Mix and made thumbs up (supported) for those that criticized it. More so, some people advised her to pull down the post that she’s destroying someone’s business but she blatantly refused.</p>



<p>It became evident that the intent and purposes of Chioma Egodi was not to review the product but was out to destroy it. It was further evident that she was hired to destroy the product using her platform.</p>



<p>Erisco Responds To Chioma Egodi’s Allegation</p>



<p>When the management of Erisco Foods Ltd was notified about the post by Chioma Egodi, they enquired from there customer relations department if there was any official complaint from her on their product, they found none. They reached out to Chioma Egodi through a third party requesting her to bring the product she claimed to buy for verification to ensure if wasn’t a fake one, but she declined.</p>



<p>The management had no choice than to defend its reputation as the tense situation already generated a campaign of calumny to boycott Erisco’s products.</p>



<p>Prompt Corporate Response</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="355" height="548" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17102790556848678708664822998141.jpg?resize=355%2C548&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-145092" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17102790556848678708664822998141.jpg?w=355&amp;ssl=1 355w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17102790556848678708664822998141.jpg?resize=194%2C300&amp;ssl=1 194w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>Erisco Foods, aware of the weight words carry in the digital era, especially when concerning public health, took these accusations seriously. The company, recognizing the potential harm such statements could have on consumer trust and public safety, responded promptly. They maintained that their product was safe, adhering to all health and safety standards, and that Egodi’s claims were not based on factual evidence.</p>



<p>The company further reached out to Chioma Egodi to bring the used Tin of the Nagiko Tomato Mix she tasted that was full of sugar or send the product batch number and production date so that the company can be sure it was their product she was talking about and not a fake one. Chioma declined all entreaties.Erisco then decided to use the legal route to clear its name.</p>



<p>Legal and Police Involvement</p>



<p>Given the gravity of the claim that a food product was endangering lives, Erisco Foods Management petitioned the Police on a complaint of Criminal Conspiracy, de-marketing and blackmail of killing people by an organized body. That’s how the Nigerian police became involved. The police invited Chioma Egodi for investigation on the strength of Erisco’s letter.</p>



<p>Chioma Egodi’s Apology.</p>



<p>During the Police investigation, Chioma Egodi offered and penned a remorseful apology with a promise of retraction as well as posting the apology on her page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="476" height="1024" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17102791258575825149932743280468.jpg?resize=476%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-145093" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17102791258575825149932743280468.jpg?resize=476%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 476w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17102791258575825149932743280468.jpg?resize=139%2C300&amp;ssl=1 139w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17102791258575825149932743280468.jpg?w=502&amp;ssl=1 502w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>&#8220;I sincerely wish to apologize to Erisco Foods Limited for the post I made on Facebook about their product Nagiko Tomatoes mix. I am truly sorry for the product. I am fully sorry sir. I regret my actions and wish to be forgiven. I pledge that this type of bad behavior will never happen again. I undertake to retract all my earlier post on this matter immediately. This is without any compulsion. I will do everything within my power to rectify the mistake and wrong concerning the matter. All the things I told wrongly about the damage done to the company, its customers and the general public. Once again, I am very sorry for the offense.&#8221;</p>



<p>Chioma Failed To Retract</p>



<p>On the grant of bail, Chioma failed to retract her false allegation and started a campaign of calumny against Erisco Foods, saying she was forced to write the apology. The implication of this is that she still stands by her statement that Erisco Nagiko Mix is killing people.</p>



<p>Evasion After Bail</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="450" height="1024" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17102791466058257388815395342919.jpg?resize=450%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-145094" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17102791466058257388815395342919.jpg?resize=450%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17102791466058257388815395342919.jpg?resize=132%2C300&amp;ssl=1 132w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17102791466058257388815395342919.jpg?w=540&amp;ssl=1 540w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>Recall that based on the understanding that Chioma will use the same medium she used to allege that Erisco Nagiko Tomato Mix was killing people, to use same medium to retract her statement, Chioma was released on bail with a condition she will be available to complete peaceful settlement process. Instead of following through with her obligations agreed on, she reneged on the conditions of her release and continually jumped bail given to her by the Police. Severing ties with the lawyer who had initially represented her in Abuja, and a relation that signed her bail bond. Chioma turned to Inibehe Effiong, leaving a trail of unanswered questions and legal challenges in her wake. She equally made herself incommunicado making it impossible for the police to serve her with the court processes and refused to appear in court severally, which prompted the Judge to mandate Inibehe Effiong to produce her in Court at the next adjourned date.</p>



<p>Affirmation of Product Safety</p>



<p>The Nigerian regulatory agencies gave its update on the status of Erisco Nagiko Tomato Mix for consumption.</p>

<ol>
<li>NAFDAC.</li>
</ol>



<p>NAFDAC with its mandate to safeguard public health released a statement:</p>



<p>&#8220;Update on the Registration Status of Nagiko Tomato Mix. The product in question &#8211; Nagiko Tomato Mix by Erisco Foods Limited with NAFDAC Registration Number A8-7430 is a registered product. The formulation of tomato paste and ketchup products with sugar is safe for consumption.&#8221;</p>



<ol start="2">
<li>The Lagos State Government&#8217;s Consumer Protection Agency, LASCOPA, weighed in with its findings: in its public statement, &#8220;LASCOPA SAYS NAGIKO TOMATO FIT FOR CONSUMPTION</li>
</ol>



<p>Contrary to claims made by one Mrs. Chioma Egodi on Facebook about the state of a tin tomato product named NAGIKO Tomato Mix 400g, the Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency, LASCOPA has declared that the product is safe for consumption and does not pose any health hazard to the consuming public.</p>



<p>A statement signed by the General Manager of LASCOPA, Afolabi Solebo said the certification by LASCOPA about the product follows the outcome of the laboratory tests which the product was subjected to upon the complaint from the consumer.</p>



<p>According to him, to authenticate her claim, LASCOPA had embarked on an independent investigation by inviting Erisco Foods Limited, the producer of the product and Egodi to two different meetings held on the 3rd and 10th of October, 2023.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="576" height="1024" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17102790850368772133463654652765.jpg?resize=576%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-145096" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17102790850368772133463654652765.jpg?resize=576%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 576w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17102790850368772133463654652765.jpg?resize=169%2C300&amp;ssl=1 169w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17102790850368772133463654652765.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>In his words, “The outcome of the meetings informed the decision of LASCOPA to request for samples of the product which were subsequently taken to the laboratory for test and analysis as well as to ascertain the conformity of the sets of parameters of the product samples to establish if the product is safe for consumption or otherwise”.</p>



<p>“It must be noted that two samples of the product were taken from Erisco Foods Company and another two sets of samples were obtained from a market survey by LASCOPA to balance and ensure a true reflection of the state of the product from both the company and the market.</p>



<p>&#8220;The laboratory analysis of the two sets of samples collected for Microbial and Physicochemical tests showed that the product passed all the tested parameters and it is safe for consumption based on the outcome of the test conducted&#8221;, he added.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the product has been in the market since 2010, duly certified by Standards Organisation of Nigeria and NAFDAC and no issue of complaint has arisen since inception.</p>



<p>Wrong Perception in the Court of Public Opinion</p>



<p>The case of Chioma Egodi versus Erisco Foods Limited reverberated through the court of public opinion, a forum often swayed by sentiment and emotions rather than facts. The discourse surrounding the incident highlighted the need for a balance between freedom of speech and the accountability that must accompany public declarations, especially when they concern the health and well-being of consumers.</p>



<p>Now, we&#8217;re left with deep questions that touch our hearts and make us think about what&#8217;s really going on.</p>



<p>Why is Chioma working so hard to ruin a company&#8217;s good reputation, a company that has been feeding countless families for years?</p>



<p>What makes a person ignore the damage they could do to the people who rely on that company for their jobs? It could be deduced from the foregoing that the goal was never to review the product, but instead about causing so much trouble that the company might close down?</p>



<p>These questions make us think about the kind of community we want. Do we want to live in a place where people can make big accusations without proof, putting hard work and jobs at risk? Or do we want a community where we solve problems by talking, looking at the facts, and finding the truth?</p>



<p>This story about Erisco Foods and Chioma isn&#8217;t just about a fight between a company and one person. It shows us what we value, what we stand for, and the future we want to create. Let&#8217;s not get carried away by false claims and narratives. Instead, let&#8217;s look for the truth with open hearts and minds. It&#8217;s not just about Erisco; it&#8217;s about our honesty and how we care for our community.</p>

<p>Reno Omokri words read:</p>



<p>In this photo you see Bishop Oyedepo kneeling before Pastor Adeboye for prayers. In the Catholic Church, Cardinals do the same thing with the Pope. If we are to be honest, there is godfatherism in religion, politics, and business. You hear different pastors calling either Pastors Adeboye, Oyedepo, Oyakhilome, and so on, their spiritual fathers. What is that? You witness various entrepreneurs calling great men like Dangote, Adenuga, Otedola, and Elumelu their mentors. What do you call that?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="226" height="223" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702819256080.jpg?resize=226%2C223&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-144349" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>Without Generals Babangida and Abdulsalami Abubakar, General Obasanjo would not have transformed into President Obasanjo in 1999. They packaged him! Without Obasanjo, Yar&#8217;adua could not have defeated Babangida and Buhari. Never. Without Obasanjo again, President Jonathan would not have defeated Buhari in 2011. And without Tinubu, Buhari would have been a washed-up has been.</p>



<p>How many of you who went to boarding schools could have survived and thrived without a school father or mother?</p>



<p>Whether you call it spiritual father, mentor, or Jagaban, godfatherism is a way of life on Earth. A mentor, like Pastor Enoch Adeboye, shortens the distance between you and success. But when you try to shorten the distance between you and your mentor, the mentor can metamorphose into a tormentor, the way the Bishop of Enugu did to Reverend Mbaka!</p>



<p>Even that statement that pastors like to use, &#8216;God does not call the qualified, He qualifies the called&#8217;, if you analyse it, what does it mean? David, the last born of Jesse, became king of Israel over his seven older brothers. Favour and grace are just another name for godfather!</p>



<p>It is just that too large a critical mass of the sub-Saharan Black Africans are emotive rather than strategic. And insult and aggressiveness are just a way of life of particular ethnicities amongst our people. But when managed properly, it can be a good model for success. Otherwise, this is a fact of life.</p>

<p>Actor, Ali Nuhu has called on Muslim no to do something that will drive others people away from the religion.</p>



<p>The award winning actor says this in his special Friday message share on his Facebook page.</p>



<p>While emphasizing how Islamic religion welcome others, he charges Muslim to stop condemning people because of the littles things, because it drives them aways.</p>



<p>His words read; &#8220;Make things easy for others. Give glad tidings and don&#8217;t chase people away from the religion. Islam welcomes all and we shouldn&#8217;t be so harsh on others that we end up condemning and judging them for small things that drive them away from Islam. Don&#8217;t be too strict or harsh in your manners or opinions that you intimidate others. Islam is the middle way and one of peace so be a person who is good to others and is an example of Islam in every way. <code>Jumua Mubarak</code>&#8220;</p>

<p>I feel unbelievably betrayed by feminism,” 38-yr-old single lady says, as she reveals she’s scared of ending up alone and childless</p>



<p>A 38-year-old lady has blamed feminism for being the reason she’s still single with no child to call her own.</p>



<p>Melissa Persling, in a recent article for Business Insider, reveals she’s scared of growing old alone and childless.</p>



<p>In the article titled: “I’m 38 and single, and I recently realized I want a child. I’m t£rrified I’ve missed my opportunity,” Persling revealed that at 22 she married a traditional man and moved to a rural community in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, where she grew up.</p>



<p>“He wanted a simple life with children and home-cooked meals. At that time I felt very strongly I did not want children, that I wasn’t going to be like the traditional housewife. I knew I did want to pursue a career, and I felt very strongly that that would never change. And I guess I was wrong,” she told Fox News.</p>



<p>Persling said both her and her ex thought that love could conquer everything, but after 10 years, it was clear their differences in life goals were irreconcilable. Persling said she became resentful when he would ask for dinner or for his laundry to be done.</p>



<p>“I did little to hide my disdain for our small-town life. He was a good and hardworking man, but I don’t think I made him feel that way,” she said. At 30, Persling and her ex divorced.</p>



<p>“I told my friends and family I’d never get married again. I needed independence, a fulfilling career, and space to chart my own course, and I didn’t think marriage fit into that vision. I was content to look toward a future without a husband, children, or the trappings of a ‘traditional’ life,’” she wrote.</p>



<p>As she grew older, however, the fun, carefree lifestyle – being wined and dined, going to parties – began to get old. When she turned 38, terror began to take over.</p>



<p>“I was panic-stricken. I really thought I’m going to be alone forever. It really scared me. I don’t want people to miss out on the important things in life because they’re just enjoying themselves because I don’t think that that’s ever going to really make you happy,” she said.</p>

<p>His words read:</p>



<p>The first photo is of several 800-year-old Ife Bronze heads depicting Oonis of Ife. The second photo is of a five-hundred-year-old Benin nobleman. There are several others, and they are mostly domiciled at the British Museum, at Great Russell Street, in London. Their ages were carbon-dated to almost exact precision. Notice that the Yoruba nobleman is dressed in royal finery. The Edo warrior also carries a shield and rides on a horse. These were not civilisations that were limited to a few clay pots and other primitive utensils.</p>

<p>History does not lie. It will be very hard to convince an objective person that people who had achieved this level of sophistication and progress 800 years ago could not build cities for themselves. It is more historically accurate to say that because of their cultural development and civilisation, they built villages, towns, and cities, perhaps with their kith, the Binis, which made others want to leave where they were from to benefit from the progress that existed amongst the Edekiri Lukumi Omoluabi people, now known as Yoruba.</p>



<p>Only two people in the Nigerian project possess documentary evidence of themselves with clothes, shields, metal weapons and organised under one King who was their central authority from at least five hundred years ago: the Yoruba (800 years ago) and the Binis (600 years ago).</p>

<p>In his words: “In the past, l was a champion when it comes to prosperity preaching. Those of you who can still remember can testify to that. l was swimming in materialism preaching and it worked well for me.</p>



<p>l wrote so many books on how to become rich. Such books are misleading. So, if you still have any of those books, l advise you to burn them, because they can&#8217;t take you to Christ.”</p>
