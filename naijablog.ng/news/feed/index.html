<p>The national grid reportedly experienced a fresh collapse in the early hours of Monday, April 15, throwing the country into total darkness.</p>



<p>This comes barely three weeks after the grid collapsed on Thursday, March 28, the fourth in 2024.</p>



<p>BusinessDay reports that data obtained from the Nigerian System Operator’s portal, reveals the grid recorded an unprecedented zero Megawatts (MW) at t about 2:00 am and is currently generating a meagre 52.3MW around 7:10 am the same day.</p>



<p>According to the report, the consequences of this blackout were felt nationwide, as electricity distribution companies (DisCos) struggled to cope with the sudden and prolonged outage.</p>



<p>This collapse marks the fifth grid disturbance in 2024, adding to challenges that have long plagued Nigeria’s power sector.</p>

<p>The Kano State Hisbah Board has apprehended 11 Muslims for violating the Ramadan fast by eating during the day.</p>



<p>The arrests were made during the annual Ramadan enforcement operations, which included searches of eateries and markets.</p>



<p>The board’s Public Relations Officer, Lawal Ibrahim, who confirmed the arrests in an interview with the BBC Hausa Service monitored on Wednesday, said the arrests were made on Tuesday across the city, particularly near markets.<br />“The individuals arrested include 10 men and one woman, who was caught eating from her groundnut-selling stall,” he said.</p>



<p>He explained that non-Muslims are exempted from such enforcement activities, but if found selling food during fasting hours to Muslims, they could be considered in violation.<br />“We apprehended 11 persons on Tuesday, including a lady selling groundnuts who was seen eating from her wares, after some persons alerted us. The other 10 persons were men and were arrested across the city, especially close to markets where a lot of activities happen. We don’t arrest non-Muslims because this doesn’t concern them, and the only time they could be guilty of a crime is when we find out they cook food to sell to Muslims who are supposed to be fasting,” he said.</p>

<p>Senate President Godswill Akpabio has suspended Senator Abdul Ningi for three months over the allegation he brought that the National Assembly passed two versions of the 2024 budget.</p>



<p>He was suspended on Tuesday on the floor of the Senate. Ningi is the Chairman, Senate Committee on Population and represents PDP, Bauchi Central.</p>



<p>While the parties called for a probe into the allegation, some northern senators disowned the claims made by Ningi, saying the Bauchi State senator did not speak for them. The Bauchi senator, however, maintained his position on Monday that N3.7tn could not be accounted for in the 2024 budget.</p>



<p>In the plenary on Tuesday, Senator Olamilekan Adeola (APC, Ogun West) raised a motion that there is urgent need to address the false allegation by Ningi.<br />Adeola, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, read the transcript of Ningi’s Hausa BBC interview on the floor of the house after Senate President Godswill Akpabio called for a committee of the whole house.<br />Meanwhile, Senator Jimoh Ibrahim moves for the suspension of Ningi for 12 months while adding that Senator Sumaila Kawu (Kano South, NNPP) be warned.</p>



<p>Senator Chris Ekpeyong (Akwa-Ibom North-West, PDP) opposed by moving a motion of amendment that it be adjusted to six months and it was seconded. Another Senator said a three-month suspension should be adopted.</p>

<p>The Senior Pastor of Household of David Church, Lagos, Olusola Osunmakinde, has reacted to the Wednesday fire that burnt down the entire church auditorium, saying &#8220;It is a painful experience.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to Osunmakinde, someone who walked into the church premises mocked him by asking, &#8220;Where was Jesus when this happened?&#8221;</p>



<p>The pastor spoke in a video shared on the church’s Instagram account a few hours after the incident occurred.</p>



<p>The Household of David Church which is located on Surulere Road, Ikeja Local Government Area of Lagos State reportedly caught fire, and property worth millions of naira were destroyed.</p>



<p>The Lagos State Fire Service spokesperson, Amodu Shakiri, disclosed to our correspondent that the church’s auditorium ceiling was overheating, which caused the ceiling to collapse and ignite a fire.</p>



<p>The church programme tagged, &#8216;Mercy Conference&#8217;, was to start today, January 31, 2024 before the church was engulfed by fire.</p>



<p>Osunmakinde stated that the church air conditioners, chairs, and other equipment were all burnt.</p>



<p>He said, “As we know, &#8216;Mercy Conference&#8217; starts today, but something happened that I just want to put a message out there to people.</p>



<p>&#8220;I came here this morning, everybody was setting up, everything was going fine. All of a sudden, we started hearing that there was fire and something up there on the roof of the church.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know there would be reactions, and people will say that and that, but that is none of my concern now. The most important thing is this, we thank God no life was lost and we thank God for everything.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are not too discouraged but we believe in God that we will still go on with the conference.</p>



<p>&#8220;To everyone out there, we are not sad, we are happy for all things work together, the Bible didn&#8217;t say all good things, all things both bad and ugly.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is a painful experience no doubt, even someone walked into the compound mocking, saying &#8216;where is Jesus when this happened?&#8217; We don&#8217;t owe people an answer, all we believe is that all things work together.</p>



<p>&#8220;We will know what to do about the building and every prayer, every contribution, every word is necessary now. Today&#8217;s meeting goes on this evening if we have to lift our hands and worship outside we will do it.</p>



<p>&#8220;We will not back out because of this but by the grace of God, all things work together for good.&#8221;</p>

<p>A Second Prosecution Witness, PW2, in the trial of a former governor of Sokoto State Attahiru Bafarawa, Kassim Yusuf, on Tuesday, January 30, 2024, recounted before Justice Yusuf Halilu of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, High Court, Abuja, that the former governor diverted a staggering N4.6billion he received as security fund from the office of the former National Security Adviser, NSA, Colonel Sambo Dasuki.</p>



<p>The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, is prosecuting Bafarawa on amended 25-count charges bordering on criminal breach of trust and diversion of public funds to the tune of N4.6billion. Other defendants in the case are, Bashir Yuguda, Colonel Sambo Dasuki (rtd), Dalhatu Investment Limited and Sagir Attahiru.</p>



<p>Yusuf, an officer of the EFCC, who was led in evidence by the prosecution counsel, Rotimi Jacobs, SAN, informed the court that N4.6billion security funds received by Dalhatu Investment Limited from the Office of the former National Security Adviser, ONSA, Colonel Dasuki were used to sponsor Sokoto State indigenes on Muslim pilgrimage and finance Bafarawa’s 2015 presidency quest, as well as offset his overseas mortgage, and acquisition of expensive vehicles comprising Lexus, Toyota Hilux pickups and 16 Peugeot 206 cars for Peoples Democratic Party, PDP local government chairmen in the state.</p>



<p>The PW2 further revealed that N1bn was given out from the sum to about 10 Bureau De Change, BDC operators for conversion to dollars. “About 10 BDCs said Dalhatu Investment Limited sent somebody to collect the money and about N800 million was transferred to Dalhatu Investment Ltd’s domiciliary account to be converted to dollars. Funds were paid to a company called Development Strategy International Ltd. The directors of the company are Islam Wali and Muhammad Wali who are cousins to Ambassador Abdullahi Wali,” he said.</p>



<p>The witness further revealed that Ambassador Abdullahi Wali received the sum of N5580million from Dalhatu Investment Ltd, which Bafarawa released to him for his 2015 Sokoto State gubernatorial aspiration.</p>



<p>“The Lexus that was purchased was bought by Dalhatu Investment for Abdullahi Wali’s election. Muazu Madawaki who received N322million was also invited. He told the investigation team that the money was for payment for Umra and Hajj allowances, hotel accommodation and flight tickets for some Sokoto State pilgrims. Ahmed Yahya received N327million and when he was invited he said the money was for political activities. He is the personal assistant to Bafarawa. Ibrahim Maigana received N111million from Dalhatu Investment for political activities in Sokoto State. He was the Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, at that time. One Musa Soba received N85million on behalf of nine aspirants in the state for the House of Representatives&#8221;, he said.</p>



<p>The witness further informed the court that one Muhammad Gambol supplied the Toyota Hilux pickups and 16 Peugeot 206 for the political campaigns of Ambassador Wali.</p>



<p>&#8220;I recovered about 14 of those PDP local government chairmen&#8217;s cars. One Amanze Obi received the sum of N15.3million for political publicity for Alhaji Attahiru Bafarawa Presidential campaign. About £123,000 (One Hundred and Twenty-three Thousand Pounds) were transferred to the United Kingdom to offset a mortgage for Alhaji Attahiru Bafarawa. We wrote back to the National Security Adviser, Major General Muhammad Mungonu and he confirmed that the monies were simply diverted without executing the project,” he said.</p>



<p>After listening to the testimony of the witness, Justice Halilu adjourned the matter till April 14, 2024 for continuation of trial.</p>
