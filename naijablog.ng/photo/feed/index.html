<p>Recall that the veteran actor passed on a few weeks ago after battling illness for a couple of months.</p>



<p>According to content creator Tosin, during a meeting today, the brother and first son of Mr Ibu got into a fight which resulted in bruises and bleeding.</p>

<p>The Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, has paid a condolence visit to the Al-Kadriyar family, whose six daughters were abducted on January 2.</p>



<p>During the visit to the family on Tuesday, Obi expressed concerns over the rate of kidnappings in the country and urged the government to curb insecurity.</p>



<p>Obi said, &#8220;I came to have the opportunity of condoling the family and then see the young ones that are still in the hospital.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is for all of us to sacrifice everything possible to see that criminality is contained.</p>



<p>&#8220;Can you imagine how it feels for a father to lose a young daughter. Imagine Folashade&#8217;s family as well. Just imagine the trauma. Imagine what they are going through.</p>



<p>&#8220;The government and the people must work hard to stop this. It is a very sad situation, I don&#8217;t even know how to start commenting, because this is happening everyday. We can&#8217;t continue this way.&#8221;</p>



<p>The PUNCH reports that about 19 abductees were taken away by bandits from the Sagwari Estate Layout in the Dutsen-Alhaji area in the Bwari Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory earlier in January.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="678" height="452" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fb_img_17066381736692601427984274130552.jpg?resize=678%2C452&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-144567" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fb_img_17066381736692601427984274130552.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fb_img_17066381736692601427984274130552.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>They included six girls who were abducted from their home alongside their father, Alhaji Mansoor Al-Kadriyar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fb_img_17066381799318123730975578746076.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-144568" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fb_img_17066381799318123730975578746076.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fb_img_17066381799318123730975578746076.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>It was gathered that the gunmen later released their father, asking him to go get the ransom for the release of his daughters.</p>



<p>The kidnappers killed four of the hostages, including Nabeeha Al-Kadriyar, a 400-level student of Biological Science, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, and 13-year-old Folashade Ariyo.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fb_img_1706638184346467264671193754819.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-144566" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fb_img_1706638184346467264671193754819.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fb_img_1706638184346467264671193754819.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>The remaining five sisters regained their freedom on Saturday, January 20.</p>



<p>The PUNCH also reports that the Nigerian Police Force, on Sunday, disclosed that they arrested a suspected kidnapper, Bello Mohammed, 28, believed to be involved in the abduction and murder of Nabeeha.</p>

<p>Some fake drink producers nabbed during the week by the police operative.</p>



<p>According to report accomplished the pictures of the fake drink circulating on social media.</p>



<p>The suspect will buy a truck of Malta Guinness from Guinness. In a pack of 24, they remove 12 and replace it with 12 fake cans of the ones they produced.</p>



<p>The originals are the ones on the outer side of the pack, while the fake ones are in between.</p>



<p>According to report, this is peculiar around Tradefair in Lagos State.</p>

<p>In a recent post on his Facebook page, Lugo, an American Ifa devotee noted that the Cotonou airport is better than the Lagos airport.</p>



<p>He also stated that he was not discriminated against as an Orisa devotee at the airport in Cotonou, as opposed to the MMIA, Lagos.</p>



<p>Sharing photos, he wrote, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been to Yorùbáland on the Benin Republic side on several occasions for several years now. My first time was in 2018.</p>



<p>&#8220;But, this was my first time flying directly into Cotonou, Benin Republic, and flying directly out of Cotonou, Benin Republic.<br />And, just for a frame of reference, I&#8217;ve been flying to Yorùbáland on the Nigeria side ANNUALLY through the Murtala Muhammed International Airport of Lagos since 1998…Annually since 1998! That is 25 years!!!</p>

<p>&#8220;Last year I flew through the airport of Lagos in and out 4 times throughout the year. One thing I can say is that there are massive differences between the Cotonou Cadjehoun International Airport and the Murtala Muhammed International Airport &#8211; Lagos.</p>



<p>&#8220;The airport in Cotonou is puny by comparison. It also has a pleasant design. The inside of the airport is clean. Their bathrooms are clean and fully functional with soap dispensers and hand dryers. Its car park is clean.</p>



<p>&#8220;There aren&#8217;t ọmọ ìta, like the ones in the airport in Lagos, all around trying to hustle you. The staff were balanced in their demeanor, professional, and friendly. In walking distance from the airport in Cotonou there are nice bars and restaurants similar to what I would find in Wynwood and other areas of South Florida.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="225" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/fb_img_17029496882226928010127524136422.jpg?resize=300%2C225&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-144408" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/fb_img_17029496882226928010127524136422.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/fb_img_17029496882226928010127524136422.jpg?resize=678%2C509&amp;ssl=1 678w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/fb_img_17029496882226928010127524136422.jpg?resize=326%2C245&amp;ssl=1 326w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/fb_img_17029496882226928010127524136422.jpg?resize=80%2C60&amp;ssl=1 80w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/fb_img_17029496882226928010127524136422.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>&#8220;Also, going through security there was no impression of religious discrimination as an Òrìṣà devotee / oníṣẹ̀ṣe (the kind of religious discrimination that I more frequently than not have experienced at the airport in Lagos).</p>



<p>&#8220;Benin Republic in general values its indigenous cultural and religious identity more than their Nigerian neighbors that give preferential treatment to foreign religions of Middle Eastern origin.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just so you are aware, at the airport, I try to dress and behave as discreetly as possible to not draw attention to myself other than the obvious.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did I mention that the air-conditioning system at both the departure and arrival areas of the airport at Cotonou works? Yes, their a/c works!!! They are not making human suya out of travelers leaving the country. Can you imagine that???</p>



<p>&#8220;And, both at the airport and most everywhere else throughout the Benin Republic, I felt overwhelmingly safe and like I was in any other country where people seemed &#8220;normal&#8221;, for lack of a better word.</p>



<p>&#8220;Here is the most important part: Not one customs official nor immigration officer nor airline staff tried to ask for a bribe nor extort money from me nor ask &#8220;what did you bring for me.&#8221; No one.!!! Is that not a normal airport?</p>



<p>&#8220;From now on I believe I will be calling the airport at Lagos the &#8216;Murtala Muhammed Flying Circus of Lagos.&#8217; To our &#8216;yOu CaNnOt CoMpArE bEnIn RePuBlIc To NiGeRiA&#8217; people &#8211; You are absolutely 100% correct!!!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was made known in a statement signed by the Director of Media and Advocacy, Femi Babafemi, shared on the agency’s page on Sunday.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="169" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824531954.jpg?resize=300%2C169&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-144362" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824531954.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824531954.jpg?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1 678w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824531954.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>The statement disclosed that the property was used as a clandestine laboratory for producing methamphetamine by a convicted drug baron, Okenwa Chris Nzewi.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824534461.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-144363" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824534461.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824534461.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>

<p>“To further deny him of enjoying the proceeds of his criminal activity, the NDLEA filed a civil forfeiture charge against the building used as a clandestine laboratory at the Federal High Court Lagos which initially granted an interim forfeiture order that elapsed on 6th December before the final forfeiture on 7th December 2023.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, NDLEA operatives in Lagos on Friday 15th December arrested a 75-year-old grandma, Mrs. Sekinat Soremekun for dealing in illicit drugs. At the time of her arrest in the Oshodi area of Lagos, quantities of cannabis and litres of codeine syrup were recovered from her. She claimed her son, Segun who is now at large supplied her the illicit substances which she retailed.”</p>
