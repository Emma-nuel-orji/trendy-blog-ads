<p>Senate President Godswill Akpabio has suspended Senator Abdul Ningi for three months over the allegation he brought that the National Assembly passed two versions of the 2024 budget.</p>



<p>He was suspended on Tuesday on the floor of the Senate. Ningi is the Chairman, Senate Committee on Population and represents PDP, Bauchi Central.</p>



<p>While the parties called for a probe into the allegation, some northern senators disowned the claims made by Ningi, saying the Bauchi State senator did not speak for them. The Bauchi senator, however, maintained his position on Monday that N3.7tn could not be accounted for in the 2024 budget.</p>



<p>In the plenary on Tuesday, Senator Olamilekan Adeola (APC, Ogun West) raised a motion that there is urgent need to address the false allegation by Ningi.<br />Adeola, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, read the transcript of Ningi’s Hausa BBC interview on the floor of the house after Senate President Godswill Akpabio called for a committee of the whole house.<br />Meanwhile, Senator Jimoh Ibrahim moves for the suspension of Ningi for 12 months while adding that Senator Sumaila Kawu (Kano South, NNPP) be warned.</p>



<p>Senator Chris Ekpeyong (Akwa-Ibom North-West, PDP) opposed by moving a motion of amendment that it be adjusted to six months and it was seconded. Another Senator said a three-month suspension should be adopted.</p>

<p>A former presidential aspirant of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Prof Iyorwuese Hagher, has resigned his membership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).</p>



<p>Prof. Hagher, a former minister, ambassador and senator, announced this in a letter dated January 22, 2024 addressed to the PDP chairman, Utange Ward in Katsina-Ala local government area of Benue State.</p>



<p>He said his ward had been beset by existential threats which had made political partisanship a risk.</p>



<p>“Since 2015, our ward has been beset by existential threats – the occupation of our farmlands and homes by Fulani herdsmen, the killings and kidnapping, taxation and torture of our oppressed poor by the local militia working in tandem with Fulani herdsmen have put political partisanship as a risk factor to our declining human rights, and even the loss of right to live.</p>



<p>“We have lost greatly and the choice of political partisanship over good and responsible governance and peace building in our community is a source of personal pain and excruciating political purposelessness.</p>



<p>“I shall continue to be a father to you, in the PDP, APC and non-partisans to help find a way to assuage our pains in our ward, Benue State and Nigeria. We shall help rebuild a new hope for a greater country with love, compassion and integrity,” Hagher said.</p>

<p>The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, in the 2023 general election, Peter Obi, has responded to a recent comment made against him by Senate President Godswill Akpabio.</p>



<p>Akpabio had recently claimed that Peter Obi did not win the presidential election in Lagos and Ebonyi States, insisting the election was rigged in those places.</p>



<p>He said, “INEC must explain to us how you [Tinubu] would lose the election in Lagos during the presidential election. And Lagos was your base. In fact, one of the other explanations INEC will make to you is how you’ll win all the federal houses in Ebonyi States and we won the three Senate seats in Ebonyi State and they said you didn’t get 25 percent..”</p>



<p>Appearing on Parallel Fact, the former Anambra State Governor was asked to react to the comments of Akpabio about his election and Obi said he does not deal with uncommon people.</p>



<p>“The Senate President is an uncommon person, everything about him is uncommon. I don’t deal with uncommon people.</p>



<p>“I deal with common people…when uncommon people talk, common people keep quiet.</p>



<p>“I won the election not just in Lagos and Ebonyi, I won the elections in Nigeria. If not for Nigeria being an uncommon place we all know what happened,” Obi said.</p>

<p>Nyesom Wike has called on the River State Governor, Sim Fubara no to pull down the ladder he used in climbing.</p>



<p>Wike says this when he received traditional rulers in house house in the state during the weekend.</p>



<p>The former governor reportedly spoke at his residence in Port Harcourt, the state capital while addressing the traditional ruler of Ogbaland, who came to felicitate with him on the occasion of his birthday.</p>



<p>The chiefs and other members of the traditional institution from Ogbaland in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area of the state were led by their traditional ruler, Nwachukwu Nnam.</p>



<p>Wike assured the monarch that he would listen, insisting that he was disposed to peaceful resolution of the crisis.</p>



<p>The minister debunked claims that the political impasse was an ethnic war, insisting that it had no tribal colouration.</p>



<p>He said: “We didn’t vote based on ethnicity…but for the unity of Rivers. We shall never be part of violence but will always support peace.</p>



<p>“There are rules within the political group you emerge. You cannot say that because an Oba has emerged and then an Oba will not follow the rules of the traditional institution.</p>



<p>“No; an Oba will always obey the rules. So also in politics, there are things you must not do and there are things you must do.”</p>

<p>Ex-governor of River State Nyesom Wike has continued to receive backlash over his loghead with his successor, Sim.</p>



<p>Reacting to the ongoing battle between former governor and the current state governor, former presidential aide, Laolu Akande, expressed his disappointment at the immediate past Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike.</p>



<p>Akande, who was the spokesman to former Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, wondered why Wike, now the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, cannot manage his own anointed governor.</p>



<p>“What is happening in Rivers State is very disappointing. Look, a lot of people had deep respect for the FCT Minister …you can easily see that Wike was the kind of guy that got it done and he got the reputation,” Akande said on Channels Television.</p>



<p>“He was called Mr. Project and all that. There’s quite a bit of political regard that you’ve to give to Wike. I think in this country today, after the President, Nyesom Wike is the most prominent politician.</p>



<p>“So, when somebody has attained that level of political relevance, it means you really have to carry yourself with a lot of grace, with a lot of measured management of the expectations around you.</p>



<p>“It is disappointing that the FCT Minister is not managing his own anointed governor and the responsibility is more on him than the governor. Wike is the senior partner in this matter and it is not good for him,” he added</p>

<p>Dr Chukwuemeka Ezeife, a one-time governor of Anambra State and former presidential adviser, lived a life symbolic of his character as a responsible and respectable elder statesman.</p>



<p>In the days when our democracy was put on a hiatus from prolonged military rule, Ezeife took a leading role in the vanguard of the struggle to restore democracy.</p>



<p>As a political leader, Ogwadike, as he was popularly known by his traditional title, exemplified the candour of a change agent who did his best to advance the good of the common man.</p>



<p>As we mourn his exit, his memory shall remind us of his legacies and inspire the contemporary generation of leaders in the country.</p>



<p>I wish his immediate family and the people and government of Anambra the fortitude to bear the loss of an icon.</p>



<p>I also join the league of his admirers worldwide to pray for a peaceful repose of his soul. -AA</p>

<p>Senate President Godswill Akpiabio reacted to alleged collapsed at his 61st birthday colloquium in Abuja on Thursday, December 14th 2023.</p>



<p>Recall that <a href="https://naijablog.ng/2023/12/15/senate-president-collapse-wheeled-on-stretcher-to-special-room-in-hospital/">report gone viral alleged that Akpabio slumped while seeing President Bola Tinubu off and was rushed to the hospital.</a></p>



<p>However, speaking at a press conference in Abuja on Friday, Akpabio said: “I have been reading on the social media the propaganda about my collapse, but I’m happy the senate press corps did not join in the show of propaganda.</p>



<p>I went home and I called my doctors and I was told that I had a bit of malaria, mingled with stress.</p>



<p>The stress could also be described in another way as exhaustion, infact anybody could be exhausted, please drink water daily so that you don’t get exhausted.</p>



<p>I want to assure Nigerians that the National Assembly is intact and we are still going on with our duty on the appropriation bill.</p>



<p>We will resume on December 20, but before then, the various committees must have finished their works to enable us meet the target to pass the budget before the end of the year for the president to append his signature.”</p>
