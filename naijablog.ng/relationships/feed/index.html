<p>A lawyer has reminded men to go for more women if they have the resources.</p>



<p>In a post share on his X account, the lawyers encourage men to be bold enough to take more women, citing that, their is nothing like cheating.</p>



<p>In his Post, he said the world cheating in relationships was introduced by women and gays to trip men into submission.</p>



<p>He wrote: “All my life, I have never cheated on any woman. Men do not cheat. They spread their seeds for genetic survival. The word &#8220;cheat&#8221; is used by simps, gays and women to guilt trip MEN into submission and make them docile. As long as you have the resources, do not be afraid to marry more women.”</p>

<p>Virginity is a pride of woman they says.</p>



<p>Every man want to marry a virgin, while every parents, mother and father want there daughter married out as a virgin.</p>



<p>Also we know woman reproductive system has expiring period.</p>



<p>The expiring period of women reproductive system is when she reaches her menopause.</p>



<p>At these period, the woman can&#8217;t give birth to children anymore.</p>



<p>Most women menopause start at the age of 45 years.</p>



<p>Some begins their menopause at earlier age, which is within 40 years of age, while some at 50 years, they are still seeing their menstruation.</p>



<p>Every woman at 40 years of age, is close to her menopause, that means be it virgin or not when she 40 years old, she is close to her menopause</p>

<p>As a guy, you and a lady, probably you guys meet few weeks or months ago, or she is your besties.</p>



<p>During a conversation with her, and she said, You can come and sleep over only when her parents are not at home, what does it mean?.</p>



<p>For me, it mean a lot&#8230;</p>



<p>First, she maybe honies and need same sexual satisfaction.</p>



<p>Or she just want to test your loyalty and faithfulness towards her as a best friend.</p>



<p>In which ever case, please don&#8217;t forget to go with protection, in case!!</p>

<p>Nollywood actress and producer, Mary Remmy Njoku, on Thursday, tackled married women who praise their husbands whenever they take care of their kids and do chores at home.</p>



<p>The actress and her husband, Jason Njoku, last Friday renewed their marital vows to mark their 10th wedding anniversary.</p>



<p>In a post shared on her Instagram page, she stated that women are the cause of their problem as husbands assisting kids should not a huge deal but rather should be seen as them being great dads to their children.</p>



<p>She said, &#8220;OMG! My husband is so humble! He helps me<br />with the kids homework! He even helped me feed junior yesterday! Dear friend, your husband isn&#8217;t helping you with the kids. They are his kids too. He is just being a great dad. Appreciate him for that.</p>



<p>“A family friend cleared his plate after eating. And his wife was showering him with praises for helping her. His own plate o<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />! Na we be the cause of OUR problems.”</p>

<p>Young Man is serious in need of your advise over trust issues from his wife.</p>



<p>He said </p>



<p>We have been Married for 5 years now, blessed with two kids boy and a girl.</p>



<p>Aldo I have been seen around, know her and her family, but we didn&#8217;t do any courtship before marriage.</p>



<p>We meet just two week, them we got married.</p>



<p>Before I married her, i didn&#8217;t have girlfriend, because am not the type that drive joy in sex.</p>



<p>And since we got married from 2018 till date, I have never cheated on her.</p>



<p>But she seen to not trust me, I don&#8217;t know why?</p>



<p>She always kick against any business I want to do because in her thought she believe I was seen a lady, or I plan the business with a lady.</p>



<p>But am suspecting, may she is doing something behind, and she thought am doing the same, if not why is she not trusting me?</p>

<p><strong><em>By Ekoson Kenny</em></strong></p>



<p>YOUNG GIRL OF 18 TO 23.</p>



<p>After thought, i came to realize that the problem of our young girls is feminism, at the age of their 18 to 23. They finds it very difficult to build a strong relationship with someone that loves and respect them. Because during this age, men are trooping and everyone wants to date them. Their WhatsApp doesn&#8217;t rest, their messenger is always filled up, if they breath on Facebook they will be getting 400likes and 350 comments.<br />they can&#8217;t walk on street each day without sssshh sssshhh from guys.<br />Now the mistake most of the ladies do is this:<br />At this level, they easily dump guy&#8217;s in relationship, any little thing they break ur heart to pieces, in their mind there are many fishes in the ocean. Over 20guys are bothering them for a relationship, so they feel they can easily hookup with another guy. They can&#8217;t bend down and build a solid relationship nor learn how to tolerate the Man that loves them.<br />At this age feminism still dey shack them well well. They no send anybody, and they don&#8217;t have time to say sorry baby.<br />For their mind marriage no go hard….Life is very beautiful they thinks, but they forget that they have only between 18 to 25 to find their presentable life partner. They chose to hang around the corner with their age mate in the name of boyfriend, instead of building a hopeful relationship with a mature minded man.</p>



<p>I use to hear people saying that they are looking for husband. But it&#8217;s like self deception to think that husband is a merchandise, No &#8220;you don&#8217;t find husband, your husband found you but feminism drived him away.</p>

<p>If you desire a loving and lasting relationship with your partner, you and your partner need to adopt the following habits below:</p>



<ol><li>COMMITMENT: Commitment is very important if you desire to have a strong relationship with your partner. You have to decide to stick with your partner and make the relationship work irrespective of the flaws your partner might have. Couples who renew their commitments everyday, in words and deed, are on their way to having a strong relationship.</li><li>KEEP YOUR PRIVATE LIFE PRIVATE: When you put your relationship on social media, you invite the public to your relationship. Keep your private matters private. It’s a relationship between you and your partner and not between you, your partner and the public. You can share your fun dates with your partner or some nice photos together on your Facebook or Instagram app but make sure you draw the line where necessary.</li><li>KNOW WHEN TO LET THINGS SLIDE AND LEARN HOW TO MANAGE CONFLICTS: Finding ways to reduce the frequency of conflict in your relationship by letting go of the little things will help you build a strong relationship with your partner. Arguments are normal in a relationship but you should make sure you never insult your partner during an argument. Always listen to what your partner has to say during an argument.</li><li>LEARN TO LISTEN: Speaking less and listening more is important if you want to build a strong relationship with your partner. It’s important you always pay close attention to what your partner has to say. Ask your partner how his/her day went and listen to him/her talk about their day.</li><li>MAKE TIME TO DATE: Spending quality time with your partner is important if you desire to build a strong relationship. Nothing substitutes for time together. No matter how busy you are, always create time to go out on dates with your partner.</li><li>BE TOTALLY TRANSPARENT: Partners in strong relationships have no secrets. If you desire to build a strong relationship with your partner, you have to be completely transparent with your partner. You don’t need privacy in your relationship if you want a strong relationship.</li><li>TRY NEW THINGS TOGETHER: Whether it be something as simple as watching a movie neither of you has seen, or something as extreme as skydiving, trying new things together as a couple is important if you want to have a strong relationship. Trying new things together keeps the excitement and passion going in your relationship.</li><li>COMPLIMENT YOUR PARTNER: You shouldn’t save the compliments for big events alone, make complimenting your partner a regular occurrence. You make your partner feel special and noticed when you compliment him/her and this helps build a strong relationship</li><li>NEVER PUT EACH OTHER DOWN IN PUBLIC: How you treat your partner in front of others matter if you desire to build a strong relationship with your partner. Never ever put each other down or say anything negative about your partner in public. Only say supportive and kind things to each other in public and save disagreements for when you both are alone.</li><li>NEVER GET TIRED OF SAYING “I LOVE YOU”: These three little words “I love you” are important if you want to build a strong relationship with your partner. No matter how long or hard your day was, always end your day by telling your partner how much you love him/her. End your day with the words “I love you”.</li><li>LEARN HOW TO COMPROMISE: You have to understand the value of compromise if you want to build a strong relationship. You may not always want to do what your partner wants but if it’s important to your partner, do it with a smile on your face.</li><li>Pray and Play Together: Couples that pray and play together stay together. Hand in hand each morning before you face the vicissitude of life, read a devotional and pray together.</li></ol>



<p>Take turns to pray for your marriage, your challenges &amp;your children. If its your turn to pray, lift your spouse&#8217;s burdens to The Lord and thank God for the wonderful spouse He gave you.</p>



<p>Never miss an opportunity to celebrate life&#8217;s milestones together. Celebrate anniversaries and birthdays. Make it simple and sweet. Play and laugh together. Be merry with the person you married and watch your love for each other grow from strength to strength.</p>



<p>You will not fail in marriage in Jesus name <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64f.png" alt="🙏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

Making love is an experience</li><li>Having sex can make you feel dirty, cheap, evil, used. Making love will always make you feel full, happy, loved up</li><li>Having sex is all about the orgasm. Making love is about intimacy</li><li>In affairs, people have sex, they don&#8217;t make love. Unfaithfulness has nothing to do with making love</li><li>People have sex because of lust. People make love because of love</li><li>Having sex can happen with many partners, that&#8217;s why players play. Making love is exclusive</li><li>Having sex can lead to unwanted pregnancies. Making love can lead to unplanned or planned pregnancies, but never unwanted pregnancies. Making love is done in a setup of love and commitment, you are building a future together, the child becomes a fruit of your love</li><li>Having sex is all about the physical: the boobs, the bum, the thighs, the man&#8217;s tool, the tightness. Making love goes beyond the body, right to the heart</li><li>Having sex is all about the performance: did you scream loud enough, did it last long enough, is he big enough, did she get wet enough, was it better than with my ex? Making love is about being close. Having sex puts pressure on how you perform, making love eases the pressure to give you affection and pleasure</li><li>Having sex leads to boredom, you get bored and look for a new sex target once you have tasted. Making love is permanent, a meal that fills you up, you don&#8217;t taste, you feast</li><li>Having sex is about giving it a test drive. Making love is not a test, you don&#8217;t make love out of curiosity</li><li>Having sex is done in secret, that&#8217;s why many say &#8220;Keep it on the down low, no one has to know&#8221;. Making love is done with pride, the world knows you two belong exclusively to each other</li><li>Love songs of the past used to sing about making love, they touched our hearts. It is difficult to find a real love song these days, much of what they sing about is mere sex; and we wonder why so many of us feel lost, empty and hurt</li><li>Having sex leads to shallow bonds. Making love leads to a deeper connection</li><li>A woman loves it when her hubby tells her &#8220;I want to make love to you&#8221; and not &#8220;I want to have sex with you. The former makes her feel most special</li><li>A man keen on having sex sees women as sex objects, a man keen on making love sees her as a woman, a queen. A king makes love to his queen, an immature male sexes women and brags about how many women he has slept with or how the trophy woman fell for him easily in bed</li><li>The orgasm when making love is sweetest; it touches your entire being: mind, body, spirit, heart, emotions and soul</li></ol>
