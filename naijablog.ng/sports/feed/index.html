<p>Investigate Victor Osimhen To Know If He&#8217;s Using Jazz or Belongs To A Coven- Nigerian Columnist Azuka Onwuka Says</p>



<p>Nigerian Columnist, Azuka Onwuka has said that Victor Osimhen should be investigated thoroughly after the striker rose tall to score airlifting goal against Monza few days ago.</p>



<p>Onwuka wrote on his Facebook page,</p>



<p>&#8220;It has been proved repeatedly that Victor Osimhen does not use any performance-enhancing drvgs. But nobody has investigated if he belongs to any coven where members are given the power to fly.</p>



<p>If not, how can a normal human being fly like this? Even Cristiano Ronaldo does not fly this high.</p>



<p>Abeg, Osimhen needs to be thoroughly investigated to know the &#8220;jazz&#8221; or ·ªçt·ª•m·ªçkp·ªç he is using or his rank in the coven.<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f61c.png" alt="üòú" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> &#8220;</p>

<p>Normally, the offside line is drawn in relation to the last but one player behind (usually the last defender before the keeper in normal circumstances). However, when the keeper rushes off his line ahead of a defender as seen below, the goalkeeper becomes the last but one player and becomes the point where the offside line is drawn. Therefore, as seen above, every Nigerian player behind ONDOA is offside.</p>



<p>The Cameroon defender on the line is then considered as the goalkeeper and the goal is cancelled because the Nigerian players who are offside are blocking the view of the Cameroon player on the line.</p>



<p>The is explanation was written by Ade Divine.</p>
