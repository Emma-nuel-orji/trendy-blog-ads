<p>A member of the Senate Committee on Trade, Senator Adams Oshiomhole, has criticised the Minister for Trade, Industry and Investments, Doris Uzoka, for proposing N1 billion in the 2024 budget for a foreign trip to Geneva, Switzerland.</p>



<p>Uzoka appeared before the Senate Committee on Trade on Tuesday, December 12, to defend her budget.</p>



<p>Report PUNCH seen by Naijablog confirmed that the minister told the joint committee that N905 million was earmarked for overhead costs while N8.1 billion was allocated to capital expenditure.</p>



<p>Reacting to her presentation, Oshiomhole, Senator representing Edo North, urged the minister to utilise in-country expertise to cut costs, emphasising the need for homegrown products and questioning the lack of data on Nigeria&#8217;s Balance of Trade.</p>



<p>He said, “I see that you intend to travel to Geneva next year and you have budgeted over N1bn for that.</p>



<p>&#8220;We can’t keep going on with over-bloated teams on foreign trips. Use the experts we have in your offices in the country to save costs.</p>



<p>&#8220;Madam sit in your office and work for Nigerians. I have gone there twice. You are always in the Bank of Industry. If you preferred BoI, you should have declined the President’s nomination to be a minister.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let’s practise what we preach. We can’t talk about industrialisation and keep importing toothpicks and tyres. We must ensure that we have homegrown products.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is our balance of trade, especially with China? Those countries exporting things to Nigeria are expected to build factories in Nigeria. We have to take advantage of our population to grow our industries?&#8221;</p>



<p>In her response, the minister defending her budget stated that she could work from anywhere, and revealed plans to establish a Trade Intelligence Unit for generating and storing trade data.</p>



<p>She said, “I assure you that I can work from anywhere and give Nigerians results. My office is currently under renovation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sir, I regret to say that we seem to have no record of our balance of trade. Or at least, it doesn’t exist in the ministry and that is why we initiated a new unit called Trade Intelligence Unit to ensure that such data is generated and stored.”</p>



<p>However, Oshiomhole disputing the claim, asserted that relevant data already exists with agencies like the CBN and Customs.</p>

<p>A former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former governor of Edo State, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, yesterday, said mobilisation of voters from the unit level and a united party are what would lead the party to victory in the 2023 presidential election and also reclaim the state from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2024.</p>



<p>Oshiomhole stated this in Benin City when he held a meeting with leaders of the party from the 18 local government areas of the state which he also tagged a statewide reconciliation after the presidential primary of the party that produced former governor<br />of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, as its presidential candidate.</p>



<p>The Edo North senatorial candidate of the APC, who used the occasion to debunk rumours that he has endorsed any aspirant for the governorship ticket of the party ahead of 2024, called on the local government area chairmen of the party to mobilise leaders of the party in the wards to set up unit.</p>



<p>executive councils of the party to ensure total mobilisation for the 2023 elections.<br />In the meeting, declared open by the state Chairman of the party, Col David Imuse (rtd),Oshiomhole also appealed to aggrieved aspirants of the party to withdraw all cases from the courts and join the party to ensure victory at the polls.</p>

<p>The former governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole, has said that Nigerians don’t appreciate good leaders until they leave office, noting that former President Goodluck Jonathan left enviable legacies behind.</p>



<p>The ex-national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) confessed that he fought former President Jonathan out of office due to their differences in political interests.</p>



<p>He stated this at the one-year memorial lecture in honour of late Captain Hosa Okunbo, in Abuja today.</p>



<p>Oshiomhole said: “You (Jonathan) left legacies even though that I had cause to fight because it is politics. The legacy you have left, there is no successor who can afford to do less.</p>



<p>“But the logic of multi-party democracy is that even an angel can be defeated. You have set a standard that none of your successors can afford to go below.</p>



<p>“Part of your (Jonathan) legacies was when you launched the almajiri school and your thought was that no Nigerian child should be left on the street and also appropriated special funds.</p>



<p>“These ideas are not new but what we lack is the will to transform it to practice. We never know who are our friends until when we are no more.</p>



<p>“No one is appreciated until he or she leaves office,” he said.</p>

<p>The former All Progressives Congress (APC) national chairman said the criticisms against the party’s Muslim-Muslim ticket was unfortunate.</p>



<p>Oshiomhole told newsmen in Abuja on Thursday that the problems of Nigeria are bigger than disagreements over religion.</p>



<p>The Edo ex-governor described the position of critics to the emergence of Senator Kaskim Shettima as Tiubu’s running mate as blackmail.</p>



<p>“Those leading the campaign in the APC family – if they were such believers in Christianity – had the opportunity to canvass for votes for one of the Christian candidates.</p>



<p>“But they were on record as having led the campaign on the side of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, knowing very well that he is a Muslim,” he claimed.</p>

<p>Former Edo governor Adams Oshiomhole says Bola Tinubu, the APC presidential flag bearer, has played no part in President Muhammadu Buhari’s regime and as such could not be blamed for any infraction by the government.</p>



<p>“I think in appropriating or apportioning blame or crediting people, you will look at their role. It is a fact that Tinubu himself co-founded the APC. But he never participated in governance,” Mr Oshiomhole asserted during an interview on Arise TV Wednesday morning, monitored by IgbereTV.</p>



<p>He stressed: “He never held any position in government. He didn’t carry out any contract on behalf of government. So how can you credit him either way?”</p>



<p>Though Messrs Buhari and Tinubu are leaders of the ruling APC, Mr Oshiomhole, a former national chairman of the party insisted that “You cannot say someone who never in any way participated in government be credited with the outcome of government policy or be blamed for same.”</p>

<p>Former Governor of Edo State, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole risks two-year jail-term for violating the provisions of 2022 Electoral Act by obtaining nomination forms for two elective offices in an election cycle.</p>



<p>It was learnt that Oshiomhole’s conduct is in violation of section 115 (D) of the 2022 Electoral Act, which bars candidates from obtaining nomination forms for two elective offices. The section stipulates a 2-year jail-term for candidates who run afoul of its provision.</p>



<p>Oshiomhole had obtained nomination forms for the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential ticket and also the Edo North Senatorial ticket, which he clinched after participating in the primaries.</p>



<p>The Resident Electoral Commissioner in Akwa-Ibom, Mike Igini had recently noted that the former Governor of the state, Senator Godswill Akpabio risked two-year jail term for picking two nomination forms and participating in two primary elections.</p>



<p>Also, a Federal High Court sitting in Abakaliki had ruled that a candidate cannot stand for two different primary election.<br />Justice Riman cited section 115 of the Electoral Act, which prohibited candidates from picking two nomination forms.</p>



<p>He also reiterated that erring candidates risk two-year jail term if they proceed to the polls.</p>

<p>A former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Adams Oshiomhole, has dismissed the alleged plot to Islamize Nigeria following the party’s Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket.</p>



<p>Oshiomhole assured Nigerians that the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu can’t Islamize Nigeria because his wife is a practicing Christian and a pastor.</p>



<p>Speaking with TVC, the former Edo State governor described the Tinubu-Kashim Shettima combination as a “balanced ticket.”</p>



<p>Oshiomhole suggested that the opposition was afraid of the Tinubu-Shettima ticket; hence such allegations.</p>



<p>According to Oshiomhole: “It is a balanced ticket; balanced ticket in terms of competence, and their antecedents. The opposition party are threatened by this bold decision because they are sensing defeat.</p>



<p>“What are the fears of people making this comment? They are saying there are plans to Islamize Nigerians. The candidate himself (Tinubu), has he Islamized his own family members? His wife is a Christian and a pastor.</p>



<p>“Our presidential candidate is a happily married man. He has demonstrated religious tolerance by the fact that his own wife is practising her own faith. How can a man who allowed freedom of worship in his home Islamise the country?”</p>

<p>After months and weeks of speculations, former governor of Edo State and former National of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole Monday declared to contest election into the Senate to represent Edo North Senatorial District.</p>



<p>He made the declaration when he marked his 70th birthday at his Iyamoh residence in Etsako West local government area which had several leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in attendance.</p>



<p>Oshiomhole said he chose to celebrate his birthday with his people because he was conscious of his origin as a nobody, given birth to under a tree by his mother but destined by God to be what he is today.</p>



<p>He said “It is true that for quite sometimes, many of our people have asked me why don’t you contest for the Senate and I said first APC has crisis, let us fix the crisis, let there be convention because you cannot begin to discuss what kind of baby you are going to have when you are not married.</p>



<p>“I said until APC is fixed you cannot talk of contesting election using the platform, have been chairman of the party, I know the danger we face if we are not able to fix the party and this was completed and consummated on the 25th of March and we have now elected a brand new National Working Committee and a brand new National Executive Council under the able leadership of a former governor, a former minister and a current senator, Adamu Abdullahi.</p>



<p>“We have done what needs to be done and I am inspired by the position of the new leadership for us to do what we need to do to retain power in 2023. I am therefore convinced that this is the time to proceed to the next step of the conversation which is about who lead the great people of Edo North in the senate by 2023.</p>

<p>Former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole says he would have been a convict but for a courageous judiciary that lived above partisanship.</p>



<p>He was speaking while hosting members of the Law Students Association of Nigeria, LAWSAN in his office in Abuja.</p>



<p>Oshiomhole, who is invited as guest speaker at the forthcoming National Conference on Rule of Law by LAWSAN, said he was a beneficiary of a courageous judiciary.</p>



<p>“I have been a beneficiary of very courageous judiciary and for a courageous judiciary, I would have been a convict because in the course of my work as a trade union leader, when I stepped on the toes on government redline, they deployed all the weapons including the police. They had me arrested countless times, arraigned before Magistrates and Judges for all kinds of charges, like unlawful assembly and incitement. ‘’But each time they did that, I have been fortunate to appear before judges with courage.&#8221; He said.</p>



<p>The former NLC President told the Law students that he has been defended by lawyers who most of the time provided their knowledge of the law and intellectual sagacity to defend me from government after government.</p>



<p>The National President of LAWSAN, Dr Blessing Agbomhere thanked the former Governor for his words of wisdom and advice, noting that the anticipated summit was born out of the passion to proffer solutions to the issues threatening the sovereignty of Nigeria and promote adherence to the rule of law for good governance in the nation.</p>



<p>Also at the meeting were Sen. Ibrahim Adamu Ibrahim, the Chief Clerk of the LAWSAN Senate, President of Female Law Students&#8217; Forum Unyime Stephen Ifon, Amuga Jesse Williams and Utalor Chukwudubem, President and Secretary of Binghman University LSS.</p>
