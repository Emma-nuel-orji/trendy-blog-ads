<p>His words read</p>



<p>WHY DO THE HEATHENS RAGE? WHY ARE THEY AFRAID OF ME?<br />Dear supporters, kindly Disregard the press release by some documents forgers and imposters led by the former chairman of Mubi North who lost re-election to Alh. Sani HammaAdama ( Sani Fabolous).</p>



<p>The said script is sponsored by a few individuals that thrive on illegality to the extent of forgery.</p>



<p>Their game plan is to slow my movement and distract me from the electioneering campaigns so as to give my opponent in another party an edge.</p>



<p>I am more focused than ever to win this.</p>



<p>Let the people my supporters know that they are fighting you and not me.</p>



<p>I will soon enter Mubi and the world will know who the people love.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, I call on Comrade Salihu Mustapha to order the party to arrest these imposters to avoid a breakdown in law and order.</p>



<p>A knife is two-edged all sides of the blade cut. We do not want to use ours for the sake of the party at this period of time.</p>



<p>Jahilchi cuta, chire senator wasan yara ne?</p>



<p>Their fear of me is real. BABALADDE will soon enter the town of Mubi to start my campaign officially. The street will speak for me.</p>



<p>I WILL WIN 2023 EASILY.</p>



<p>I AM SIA<br />I BELIEVE</p>

<p>The Adamawa State College of Nursing and Midwifery has suspended the admissions it started on Tuesday after some Muslims in the state protested against the payment of parts of the admission fees in a microfinance bank owned by a church.</p>



<p>The school had directed applicants to pay the sum of N500 professional fee meant for the state Nursing and Midwifery Council into an account opened in the Brethren Microfinance Bank in Yola, the state capital, where the school is also located.</p>



<p>All applicants must also pay N5,715 for the admission form. The payment for the admission form was to be paid in other banks.</p>



<p>But some Muslims, led by one Shehu Ismail, protested the school management’s decision to use the church’s bank to collect the Nursing and Midwifery Council fee.</p>



<p>The group claimed the payment would increase the bank’s financial strength.</p>



<p>Besides, they said the school’s decision to use the bank smacked off “a gradual Christianisation of the state structures”.</p>

<p>Wonder they said shall never end in Nigeria.</p>



<p>This news is from Adamawa state</p>



<p>Nigeria now in shambles as those who stood to defend themselves meet government wrath but bandits and been celebrated.</p>



<p>Young man has been sentence to death by hanging after he overpowered Fulani Herder that invaded his farm and wanted to killed him.</p>



<p>according to the report he is rice farmer, he is identified as  Kabiru Zelani he was sentence to death by hanging for overpowering his assailant, Fulani who even Inflicted dipped cut on his hand with cutlass, and destroy his farms.</p>



<p>According to the news, Kabiri allegedly overpowered the herder, identified as Ardo Ali and stabbed him to death in Adamawa State after much battle with the herder that destroy his farms.</p>



<p><br>This development is an evidence that President Muhammadu Buhari-led regime is widely seen as providing cover for Fulani herdsmen who have been notorious for invading farmlands with their cattle and destroying crops, killing farmers and raping women across the country.</p>



<p>Zelani, 22, reportedly used his attacker&#8217;s assault dagger to stab him to death during an invasion of his farmland on October 18, 2015 in the state.</p>



<p>The convict, who has been standing trial for more than 5 years, was on Tuesday handed a death sentence and would be hanged for stabbing an intruding herder, Ali, to death.</p>



<p>Justice Fatimah Ahmed Tafida of the High Court IV, sitting in Yola, the state capital, convicted Zelani, after he was tried and found guilty of culpable homicide punishable by death contrary to section 221(b) of the state penal code law.</p>



<p>The judge declared that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and that &#8220;the court hereby sentences you, Kabiru Zelani, to death by hanging until certified dead by a medical doctor&#8221;.</p>



<p>Zelani, a resident of Leme village in the Gombi local government area, was said to have stabbed Ali to death during a fight over the destruction of his (Zelani) rice farm.</p>



<p>Zelani had narrated that &#8220;while working on my rice farm on 18th October, 2015, the deceased came and put his animals on my rice farm. When I saw that the animals were destroying the crops, I confronted the herder; so he became provoked.</p>



<p>&#8220;The herder used his cutlass and struck me on my right hand, the evidence of which could be seen here, a scar, showing serious injury, and that he also pulled out his knife and tried to stab me, but I (Zelani) fell the herder on the ground.”</p>



<p>After more than 5 years of trial, the 22-year-old farmer has been condemned to death by hanging for daring to defend himself and his farm produce.</p>

<p>By Muhammad B Muhammad</p>



<p>As part of the policy objectives of the Fintiri led administration to providing access to quality and affordable healthcare services to the people, the Adamawa State Contributory Health Management Agency has concluded arrangements to commence enrollment of citizens.</p>



<p>The newly established agency came on board following the amendment of the Adamawa State Health Insurance Law number 7 of 2011 by the State House of Assembly in June, 2020 and subsequently assented to by Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri.</p>



<p>The Governor has approved 1% of the consolidated revenue of the state to provide free basic health care services to the vulnerable such as the disabled, under five children, pregnant women, the elderly from 65yrs and above as well as people living in IDP camps.</p>



<p>The Executive Secretary of the agency, Doctor Amos Ujulu in an interview with newsmen in Yola revealed that the statewide enrollment for the health insurance programme targeting all the citizens will be officially flagged off next month by Governor Umaru Fintiri.</p>



<p>He explained that the programme is free for vulnerable but for the civil servants, the agency is discussing with labour leaders and as soon as it concludes, a letter will be written to the Governor for approval and deduction will commence from their salary while those in the private and informal sectors will also make contributions.</p>



<p>According to him, in preparation to the commencement of the enrollment exercise, the agency has already recruited adhoc staff and their training is ongoing in addition to engaging an ICT firm, procured some hardware devices,health devices and laptops.</p>



<p>&#8220;His Excellency Governor Umaru Fintiri will be the first enrollee to demonstrate that the programme is for everyone and a step to achieve universal health coverage which is a global trend to ensure that people are covered to access good and quality health service without suffering financial difficulties,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Doctor Ujulu disclosed that the agency is targeting 226 primary healthcare facilities, one facility par political ward, all cottage and general hospitals across the state while the private sector also has opportunity to participate in the process.</p>



<p>He added that the agency will carry out an accreditation exercise on all the hospitals inline with the criteria of the national health insurance scheme (NHIS) and once they meet up, they will be engaged and after the enrollment exercise, people have the alternative to select which of the facilities to patronize.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Adamawa State Primary Healthcare Development Agency has repositioned all its health facilities and increased staff for the takeoff of the health insurance programme as directed by Governor Umaru Fintiri inline with the global best practice that Adamawa State has keyed into.</p>



<p>The Executive Chairman of the Agency, Doctor Suleiman Sa&#8217;idu who disclosed this in an interview with newsmen in his office said the Agency will equips infrastructure, service delivery and provides drugs consumables among others as part of realizing the 11- point agenda of Governor Umaru Fintiri.</p>

<p>In its commitment towards promoting science and technology education in Adamawa, the state government has procured mobile teaching aids for science subjects to distribute across secondary schools across.</p>



<p>This development is coming after the government recently announced recruitment of two thousand science teachers in the state for existing vacancies all aimed at enhancing teaching and learning of science subjects.</p>



<p>The Secretary to the State Government SSG, Malam Bashir Ahmad alongside some Commissioners and other top government officials inspected the equipment at Government Girls Secondary School GGSS, Yola Thursday.</p>



<p>Speaking to newsmen in an interview after he was conducted round the equipment, Malam Ahmad explained that government procured the mobile teaching aides inline with the efforts of Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri led administration to improve education sector.</p>



<p>He said the equipment will ease students understanding of science and technology subjects, thereby improving learning outcomes and assured that government will soon distribute them as schools in Adamawa will resume in the next two weeks.</p>



<p>The Secretary to the State Government who was also conducted round some science teaching aides procured by the previous administration expressed concern that the equipment were kept without being put into use for over a long time.</p>



<p>According to the SSG, lack of effective utilization of the equipment as and when due after being purchased by government has contributed to the low performance of students in science subjects in the previous years.</p>



<p>On her part, the Commissioner of Education and Human Capital Development, Mrs Wilbina Jackson said the mobile science teaching aids were purchased by the Fintiri led administration for use in places where there is no laboratory.</p>



<p>She added that mobile laboratory is a concept used in some states like Kaduna where it was introduced successfully and further said the equipment are for teaching science subjects such as Phisics, Chemistry, Biology and Agric Science among others.</p>



<p>She said soon, her ministry will invite all education stakeholders in the state to come and also inspects the equipment and proffer advice on how the equipment will be distributed to all post basic and secondary schools in Adamawa.</p>
