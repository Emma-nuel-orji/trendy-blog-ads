<p>A member of the House of Representatives, Akinola Alabi, has urged the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to open the country’s airports.</p>
<p>Alabi, who represents Egbeda/Ona-Ara Federal Constituency, also pushed for interstate travel to be allowed in the next phase of the easing of lockdown.</p>
<p>“Next phase of easing lockdown. Allow interstate travel. Then open the airports and introduce some safety measures,” he tweeted.</p>
<p>The country’s airports and airspace were shut in March by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), as part of efforts to contain COVID-19.</p>
<p>Commercial flight operations, both local and international, had stopped forthwith but the President’s directive allowed the operation of essential flights including those for medical and evacuation purposes, amongst others, which are subject to the authorisation of the Federal Ministry of Aviation and agencies under it.</p>
<p>On May 6, the Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, announced that the closure of the country’s airports and airspace were further extended by four weeks after due consultations with experts.</p>
