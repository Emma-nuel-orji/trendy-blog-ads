<p>The Senegalis born American singer, popular known as Akon has say he doesn&#8217;t do drugs nor smoke.</p>



<p>In circular that has gone viral on social media, Akon didn&#8217;t only says he doesn&#8217;t involved in drugs and smoking, but also praise himself as the only rapper in the whole music business that doesn&#8217;t smoke, drink, or do drugs.</p>



<p>Part of his words read:</p>



<p>&#8220;I get dizzy when someone smokes near me, like I just hate it. I once tried to wrap a blunt, but my dad snéâked behind me and whîppéd me so if I&#8217;m not smôkîng today, it&#8217;s all thanks to my dad, I decided to never smôké. Growing up, I was never pressed by péer pressure. You couldn&#8217;t make me do what I knew wasn&#8217;t right. It couldn&#8217;t just happen because I always sort to uphold all the morals my dad thought me.&#8221; Akon</p>



<p>Truth be told, a lot of people do funny things which they know are wrong just because they can&#8217;t resist péer pressure. Friends will tell you things like, &#8220;Grow up, one time won&#8217;t hurt,&#8221; and you&#8217;ll go ahead to do it knowing fully well that it isn&#8217;t right.</p>



<p>Many people have gone astray because they&#8217;re not living but existing and letting people decide their lives for them. In all you do, live a moral life because you aren&#8217;t here to impress people for everything you do. You shall bear the consequences alone</p>

<p>48-year-old Senegalese-American singer and businessman, Akon, has said he was much happier when he was poor because life is tougher for the rich than the poor.</p>



<p>He said this on Monday, October 4, while defending a statement he made in the wake of actor Michael K. Williams’ d<em>ath in September 2021. The artist had used Williams’ d</em>ath as proof that the more money some makes, the more problems they accumulate.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview with TMZ, he said, “Nobody can sit there and tell me, that I didn’t go through poverty. I was the young African kid, barefoot and playing soccer in the village with no electricity, no running water, I knew what that looked like – believe me, I know what poverty looks like.</p>



<p>But I also know what success looks like, and from my personal experience, I’m having more problems successfully dealing with all that comes with success than I had when I was poor. I was actually happier when I was poor.”</p>
