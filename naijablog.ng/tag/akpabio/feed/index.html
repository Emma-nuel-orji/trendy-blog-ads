<p>The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, in the 2023 general election, Peter Obi, has responded to a recent comment made against him by Senate President Godswill Akpabio.</p>



<p>Akpabio had recently claimed that Peter Obi did not win the presidential election in Lagos and Ebonyi States, insisting the election was rigged in those places.</p>



<p>He said, “INEC must explain to us how you [Tinubu] would lose the election in Lagos during the presidential election. And Lagos was your base. In fact, one of the other explanations INEC will make to you is how you’ll win all the federal houses in Ebonyi States and we won the three Senate seats in Ebonyi State and they said you didn’t get 25 percent..”</p>



<p>Appearing on Parallel Fact, the former Anambra State Governor was asked to react to the comments of Akpabio about his election and Obi said he does not deal with uncommon people.</p>



<p>“The Senate President is an uncommon person, everything about him is uncommon. I don’t deal with uncommon people.</p>



<p>“I deal with common people…when uncommon people talk, common people keep quiet.</p>



<p>“I won the election not just in Lagos and Ebonyi, I won the elections in Nigeria. If not for Nigeria being an uncommon place we all know what happened,” Obi said.</p>

<p>Senate President Godswill Akpiabio reacted to alleged collapsed at his 61st birthday colloquium in Abuja on Thursday, December 14th 2023.</p>



<p>Recall that <a href="https://naijablog.ng/2023/12/15/senate-president-collapse-wheeled-on-stretcher-to-special-room-in-hospital/">report gone viral alleged that Akpabio slumped while seeing President Bola Tinubu off and was rushed to the hospital.</a></p>



<p>However, speaking at a press conference in Abuja on Friday, Akpabio said: “I have been reading on the social media the propaganda about my collapse, but I’m happy the senate press corps did not join in the show of propaganda.</p>



<p>I went home and I called my doctors and I was told that I had a bit of malaria, mingled with stress.</p>



<p>The stress could also be described in another way as exhaustion, infact anybody could be exhausted, please drink water daily so that you don’t get exhausted.</p>



<p>I want to assure Nigerians that the National Assembly is intact and we are still going on with our duty on the appropriation bill.</p>



<p>We will resume on December 20, but before then, the various committees must have finished their works to enable us meet the target to pass the budget before the end of the year for the president to append his signature.”</p>

<p>The Independent National Electoral Commission has denied recognising Senator Godswill Akpabio and Senate President Ahmad Lawan as candidates of the All Progressives Congress. Both Lawan and Akpabio had contested the APC Presidential primaries.</p>



<p>However, after losing, both of them were listed as senatorial candidates by the APC, but INEC refused to recognise them.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, there were reports that the two had finally been recognised by the commission.</p>



<p>Responding in a statement titled, ‘Spurious Allegations in Respect of Nomination of Candidates in Some Senatorial Districts’, the commission said it had not recognised them.</p>



<p>In the statement signed by INEC National Commissioner, Festus Okoye, the commission said the matter was still in court and it would maintain the status quo.</p>



<p>“We call for responsible reportage as against the unwarranted attack on the commission and its officials over a matter than can be easily fact-checked,” the statement read.</p>



<p>The commission said a certified true copy of Form 9C was uploaded by the APC and received by the Commission on June 17, 2022 when the nomination portal closed was presented.</p>



<p>It explained that the Form EC9 submission of names of candidates by political parties is the form uploaded by parties on the INEC nomination portal.</p>



<p>“The forms of the two personalities in question were not published by the commission. The decision of the commission triggered legal actions which are still ongoing. It therefore defies logic and common sense to go around and submit doctored documents purportedly recognising the duo as candidates when the matter is clearly sub-judice,” it said. PUNCH</p>

<p>The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Sunday declared that it does not recognize former Minister of the Niger Delta, Godswill Akpabio as the senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akwa Ibom North-West senatorial district.</p>



<p>According to INEC, it will only recognize the candidate produced from the party primaries it monitored.</p>



<p>The former Minister of Niger Delta stepped down for the National Leader of the ruling party, Bola Tinubu in the just concluded presidential primary of the party.</p>



<p>Akpabio then went ahead to clinch the senatorial ticket after gathering 478 votes</p>



<p>However, reacting to the development, the INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner, Akwa Ibom State, Mr Mike Igini said the electoral umpire would only recognise the winner of the primaries monitored by INEC.</p>



<p>According to him, the re-run APC senatorial primaries, where Akpabio emerged winner was not monitored by INEC.</p>



<p>“The primaries was concluded on the 27th of last month, so I don’t know what you are talking about. The one that was conducted was monitored by INEC and the report has been submitted to Abuja.</p>



<p>“INEC is not aware of any senatorial primaries conducted on Thursday (June 9) that was monitored by INEC, none,” he stated.</p>



<p>He added in his submission that the APC has no governorship candidate in Akwa Ibom State as the governorship primary where Mr Akanimo Udofia emerged winner was not monitored by INEC.</p>

<p>The Peoples Democratic Party in Akwa Ibom, has said that the banner of the party at the venue of Minister Of Niger Delta, Godswill Akpabio&#8217;s presidential declaration, shows he can&#8217;t succeed without associating with the party.</p>



<p>Photos of a PDP banner had been spotted at the Ikot Ekpene Township Stadium, where Akpabio announced his decision to join the presidential race.</p>



<p>In a statement signed by the PDP State Publicity Secretary, Borono Bassey, the party said Akpabio&#8217;s handlers wanted to score points with the party&#8217;s name.</p>



<p>Bassey who posted the statement on his Facebook page said, &#8220;We have seen a photograph of a banner with an inscription to the effect that a party with the name – “People” Democratic Party is in support of the presidential rally of the Minister of Niger Delta, Chief Godswill Akpabio.</p>



<p>&#8220;Whereas the aforementioned “Party” does not exist as a duly registered Political Party in Nigeria and certainly not in Akwa Ibom State, we understand that the innuendo that the mischief makers set out, but failed to achieve was to use the name of our Party – The Peoples Democratic Party to score points.</p>



<p>&#8220;In light of this, we are moved by sympathy to wonder why Akpabio’s handlers chose a day like this to embarrass their principal by reminding him that any of his political aspirations will amount to nothing if such aspiration does not come on the platform of the only Party in Akwa Ibom State – the Peoples Democratic Party.</p>



<p>&#8220;As a Party, we are glad by this overwhelming decision by Chief Akpabio and his handlers to again admit the obvious truth, that without the platform of the PDP, electoral victories in the state are impossible.&#8221;</p>
