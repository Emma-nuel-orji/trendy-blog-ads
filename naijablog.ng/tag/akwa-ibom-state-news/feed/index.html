<p>Evil family when they say marry who sabi God una dey go for swag….nonsense</p>



<p>KIDNAPPING, KILLING AND SELLING OF BODY PARTS-( A FAMILY BUSINESS)</p>



<p>I said it this morning that shocking revelations will be out on this case. God is faithful!!!!!<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64f-1f3fc.png" alt="🙏🏼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>From sources at Ikot Akpanabia I’ve been briefed that the Uduak Akpan has confessed that his father started the kidnapping and killing business for so many years now, before introducing him into it. They kill people to sell their body parts. And they’ve been doing this together for many years. He has killed many. There are so many bodies buried in that shallow grave!!!!</p>



<p>If you were told people, human beings that God created, sell body parts in your neighborhood, in Akwa Ibom state, would you believe?</p>



<p>This is so inhumane and scary oh Lord!</p>



<p>More confessions coming by the power of God none involved in this will be spared.</p>



<p>So Uduak further said he and his dad kill to sell body parts and many money, and that his blood sister is also a member of the crime. That she lures her friends to come over to their house and they get killed. His girlfriend too is aware of the crime and she too lures girls endlessly over to her boyfriend and his family to be killed for money.</p>



<p>So she and his sister are the ones that lures victim and he himself too. That their mother wants dead bodies in their compound for the business too.</p>



<p>That when he lured the dead girl there, they dragged and argued and she was raped and after they killed her, he abandoned her body to the father because of the heat and pressure from Nigerians and neighbours, and ran to Okobo in Oron and the father handed over the body to EmemObong Emmanuel who is a cousin to the Uduak Akpan killer and an accomplice to the crime. (Abasi mmi amia Akan unam ino ufen).That they’re yet to know if the Ememobong’s sister Emediong too as suspected is a member of this gang of luring and killing innocent people.</p>



<p>This is a family business.</p>



<p>They use different methods to lure unsuspecting victims and this has long been going on until he was knabbed.</p>



<p>Then the pressure was too much in Oron he fled back to Uruan where he was caught and handed to the police.</p>



<p>We are yet to hear confessions from<br />Ememobong Emmanuel and others.</p>



<p>The relatives of the girl that was killed are at the police station now rioting for the corpse of their daughter and the police said the had dugged out her corpse and deposited at the university of Uyo teaching hospital.But the family is dissatisfied and wants their daughter and sister’s corpse immediately to be sure nothing fishy is on going.</p>



<p>I am awaiting more confessions and I’ll post as I receive. God has taken over this case and no secret shall be covered and no powers shall stop justice. Ghose who kill MUST be killed too!!!!</p>



<p>We need every Nigerian with a good conscience to join in this fight for #JUSTICEforINI.</p>



<p>Eye witnesses at Ikot Akpanabia are still waiting for the PPRO police for an address.</p>



<p>We want to know the buyers of this body parts too. They must be arrested because without buyers, there’ll be no sellers and killers.</p>



<p>Uduak and his family members must not be killed yet for now. They must give us every information needed so we stay careful and cautious.</p>



<p>Chai AKWA IBOM NNYIN!!!!<br />Oh Uyo!!!!<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f62d.png" alt="😭" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f62d.png" alt="😭" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f62d.png" alt="😭" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />OWO!!!!!!</p>



<p>HE MUST CONFESS publicly.<br />The deed has been done…. So now we need to know the top buyers in this state .</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Social media users are demanding to know the long term value of the International Worship Centre project embarked upon by the Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Emmanuel Udom.</p>



<p>The governor had on Tuesday shared photos of his inspection tour of the project on his verified Facebook page.</p>



<p>He captioned the photos of the giant structure, “Today I visited the ongoing International Worship Centre project in Uyo. The quality of the work done is commendable and it is the best of its kind in the world.</p>



<p>“In addition to other key infrastructure and industries we are building, we as a people are raising an altar for our God, even for generations yet unborn.”</p>



<p>His feelings were however not shared by his followers who expressed concern about the value proposition of the project.</p>



<p>Facebook user, Bassey Inyang said, “This project is complete waste of public funds that should have been channelled to the education and health sectors of the state. The uselessness of the so-called ecumenical centre in Abuja, especially the Christian section should have informed you against embarking on this useless project that would make no meaning to competing churches and clerics.”</p>



<p>Victor Ntekop said, “Question what is the effect of this worship centre to the people of Akwa Ibom and Nigeria to our economy?</p>



<p>Another Facebook user, Otto Ikpe wondered about the input of the local industries in the project. He asked, “How many indigenous contractors are engaged here? What is the level of local content patronage? Julius Berger has done so many projects in Akwa Ibom State. What investment have they done in the state from the proceeds of all these big contracts which will touch the lives of Akwa Ibom people in diverse ways? Capital flight is the reason why poverty is on the rise in Akwa Ibom.”</p>



<p>Inyanwachi Emmanuel was more direct in what ways the governor could have put public funds to use. He wrote, “What is all this naaa? Why not use the money to build industries, to employ your people? People are hungry and jobless in this country and all you think about is a multi-million dollar church?”</p>



<p>Face book user, Memie Josh quite respectfully told the governor, “Sir, we do not need more worship centres!!! We need strong educational systems, accessible and affordable healthcare and industries!”<br>On the flip side, there are those who support the governor’s move and hailed him,</p>



<p>Umoh Joseph wrote, “If God made a mistake in blessing King Solomon for building a temple for Him, may He also make another mistake in blessing you Your Excellency for also building a temple for Him in our state. Kudos Sir!</p>



<p>Another supporter of the governor, John Friday Akpata wrote, “No matter what you do, some people will still have some misgivings, soldier on my good governor. Well done. You know is written in both heaven and on earth because God never jokes with them that raise altar unto Him. Look at Obasanjo, and his completion of the Abuja ecumenical centre, he is alive and kicking. You are on the right path Mr governor.”</p>

<p>By Assam Abia.</p>



<p>The Paramount Ruler of Eket, His Majesty, Edidem E. C. D. Abia has shown great displeasure at the rampant cases of rape in Eket and has charged Village Heads to be at the forefront of fighting against the menace.</p>



<p>The Monarch made his displeasure known in a meeting held between all Village Heads and Village Council Chairmen in Eket over the weekend at his Palace.</p>



<p>Edidem Abia warned that no Village Head should attempt to settle rape cases in the community because like murder, rape is criminal in nature and should be reported to the police while victim is taken to the hospital for medical examination by a doctor and medical report produced.</p>



<p>The meeting between the Paramount Ruler and Village Heads came on the heels of a rape case reported in Ikot Odiong Eket where an innocent girl was gang raped by four boys in a bush. Some persons, according to report, attempted to settle the matter in the Village.</p>



<p>Edidem E. C. D. Abia warned that anybody or Village Head who tries to cover rape case is culpable of abating crime and must be sanctioned, adding that it was an offence to have canal knowledge with an under age girl or adult without her consent.</p>



<p>He called on parents to be alive to their responsibilities of bringing up their children in the fear of God and good morals, adding that any person caught in the act of rape does not deserve to live in the community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has described the sudden dead of the Director General of Governor Udom Emmanuel’s two terms campaign organization and Chairman of Pan Niger Delta Forum, PANDEF, Air Commodore Idongesit Nkanga rtd and the<br>Akwa Ibom State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Mr. Udo Ekpenyong, as grave losses not just to Akwa Ibom State but the entire South-South region and the party which, he said, is Nigeria’s hope.</p>



<p>The Rivers State Governor stated this during a condolence visit to Governor Emmanuel at Hilltop Mansion, Government House Uyo, on Thursday.</p>



<p>“I came here because Governor Udom has lost two, three prominent sons of Akwa Ibom State, the most painful is the former two time Director-General of his campaign organisation and the Chairman of PANDEF and then his party Chairman which is also my party and the hope for this country, PDP.</p>



<p>“I said no what affects him, affects me, what touches Akwa Ibom touches Rivers state”, Wike said.</p>



<p>He said that Idongesit Nkanga’s death was unfortunate, untimely and a sad event for both the people of Akwa Ibom and Rivers states, explaining that the loss is happening in a time when he had become a strong voice in the Niger-Delta and been at the frontline of agitations for the restructuring of Nigeria.</p>



<p>He however encouraged Governor Emmanuel to draw consolation from the word of God and hold onto his faith as a Christian.</p>



<p>Governor Wike said that God is all-knowing and cannot be questioned by man over what he has allowed, while assuring the government of Rivers State will be fully involved in all levels of the funeral arrangements for the two.</p>



<p>Wike said Governor Emmanuel has earned his respect and the love of his people by his integrity in keeping his promises to his people and his political associates.</p>



<p>He described Governor Emmanuel’s developmental strides as impressive and the governor, as a man who loves his people.</p>



<p>“Governor Udom Emmanuel is my brother, he is a man of his words, if he tells you that he will do something you can go home and sleep with your two eyes closed, again Governor Udom Emmanuel has the interest of the people of the Niger Delta at heart particularly the people of Akwa Ibom State.</p>



<p>“As we were coming in today I told the Chief of Staff that Akwa Ibom is competing with Rivers State with what I have seen, it is unbelievable”.</p>



<p>Governor Emmanuel, in his response, thanked his Rivers State counterpart and other state governors in the Niger Delta region for identifying with him in the period of grief, describing his relationship with Wike as what he values beyond their tenures in office.</p>



<p>Governor Emmanuel described the departed two-time DG of his governorship campaign organsation, Idongesit Nkanga and the State PDP Chairman as men of proven integrity and loyalty, adding that the news of Nkanga’s death, in the peak of the yuletide, threw the state into an unimaginable grief.</p>



<p>In his words, “For a man to be your two terms campaign DG, he must have proven a high level of loyalty and integrity.</p>



<p>“If Idongesit Nkanga says he loves you in front, know that he loves you all round, both in front and behind you. He was a man of that kind of integrity, character and personality. You could see, even in the South-south, he never had any wall of discrimination”.</p>



<p>“My party Chairman also, in fact when they are introducing him, they call him Mr. Loyalty. He was that loyal.</p>



<p>“He has served the party both at the state and the national levels. In short, if you want any definition for loyal, just look for Hon. Udo Ekpenyong, you’ll certainly get that anytime any day. It’s so painful”, Emmanuel said.</p>



<p>The Akwa Ibom Governor also bemoaned that the state, within the period has lost a former Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Nsikak Eduok and former Commissioner for lands in the state Executive Council, Architect Ime Ekpo, adding that the state is pained that four of her very good people are to be buried within the same period.</p>



<p>He however accepted to be consoled with the fact that every man has a set time by God to quit the earth, despite the pain, and restated his resolve to continue to provide leadership for the people of the state, with the hope that God will give the state beauty for ashes.</p>



<p>Governor Emmanuel called on all governors, leaders and stakeholders of the Niger Delta region to join him and the people of Akwa Ibom State for the funeral ceremony in honour of the PANDEF Chairman, scheduled for February 6, 2021.</p>
