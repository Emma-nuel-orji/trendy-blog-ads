<p>Actor, Ali Nuhu has called on Muslim no to do something that will drive others people away from the religion.</p>



<p>The award winning actor says this in his special Friday message share on his Facebook page.</p>



<p>While emphasizing how Islamic religion welcome others, he charges Muslim to stop condemning people because of the littles things, because it drives them aways.</p>



<p>His words read; &#8220;Make things easy for others. Give glad tidings and don&#8217;t chase people away from the religion. Islam welcomes all and we shouldn&#8217;t be so harsh on others that we end up condemning and judging them for small things that drive them away from Islam. Don&#8217;t be too strict or harsh in your manners or opinions that you intimidate others. Islam is the middle way and one of peace so be a person who is good to others and is an example of Islam in every way. <code>Jumua Mubarak</code>&#8220;</p>
