										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In clear recognition of the critical role Nigeria is playing on the global telecom stage, the country was re-elected earlier today as a Council member of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the United Nations specialised agency that oversees global telecommunication operations. Nigeria will serve on the Council again from 2023-2026.</p>



<p>The election of Nigeria and other countries, on Monday, October 3, 2022, into different regional groups that constitute ITU Council, was the highpoint of the Plenipotentiary Conference 2022 (PP-22) ongoing in Bucharest, the capital city of the Republic of Romania.</p>



<p>The Nigerian delegation was successfully led to the global event by the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami. Other members of the delegation include Chairman, Board of Commissioners of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Adeolu Akande, and the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta.</p>



<p>At the conference which started on September 26, 2022 and scheduled to end on October 14, 2022, member states at the event voted on the composition of the next ITU Council and the 12 representatives to serve on the Radio Regulations Board (RRB) for the next four years.</p>



<p>The 21st Plenipotentiary Conference of the Council, also saw the election by member states, of Doreen Bogdan-Martin of the United States of America as the organisation’s next Secretary-General.</p>



<p>Like Nigeria and the countries elected into the Council, Bogdan-Martin, as the first woman to lead ITU in its 157-year history, will begin her four-year term from January 2023, when Houlin Zhao would have completed his second final term of four years in office as ITU Secretary General.</p>



<p>The seats in ITU Council are divided into five regions, A to E. Nigeria was elected into the ITU Council Region D for Africa, which has 13 seats. Other 12 countries elected alongside Nigeria are Algeria, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Tunisia, and Uganda.</p>



<p>Elections of member states also took place into the Region A for The Americas (nine seats); Region B for Western Europe (eight seats); Region C for Eastern Europe &amp; Northern Asia (five seats); and Region E, for Asia and Australasia with 13 seats as Africa.</p>



<p>Commenting on Nigeria’s re-election as ITU Council member, the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Prof. Umar Danbatta, thanked the ITU member states for the confidence it has in Nigeria, expressed by the re-elected into the ITU Council, in which the country has been playing critical role over the years.</p>



<p>“The re-election of Nigeria as a member of ITU Council for the next four years, again points to the globally-recognised leadership role Nigeria is playing in Africa and at the level of ITU Council in the area of telecommunications policy formulation and technical regulations development to drive ITU’s mission and vision,” the EVC said.</p>



<p>The ITU, originally established in 1865 as the International Telegraph Union and became a United Nations specialised agency in 1947, was set up to coordinate telecommunications operations and services throughout the world. It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>



<p>Nigeria became a member of ITU on November 4, 1961. The USA joined on July 1, 1908; United Kingdom, February 24, 1871, and UAE on June 27, 1972.</p>



<p>The ITU is governed by the Plenipotentiary Conference and the Administrative Council. The Plenipotentiary Conference is the supreme organ of the Union. It is the decision-making body which determines the direction of the Union and its activities.</p>



<p>The Council, on the other hand, acts as the Union’s governing body in the interval between Plenipotentiary Conferences. Its role is to consider broad telecommunication policy issues to ensure that the Union&#8217;s activities, policies, and strategies fully respond to today&#8217;s dynamic, rapidly changing telecommunications environment.</p>



<p>ITU Council also prepares a report on the policy and strategic planning of the ITU, and it is responsible for ensuring the smooth day-to-day running of the Union, coordinating work programmes, approving budgets, and controlling finances and expenditure.</p>



<p>The Council also takes all steps to facilitate the implementation of the provisions of the ITU Constitution, the ITU Convention, the Administrative Regulations (International Telecommunications Regulations, and Radio Regulations), the decisions of Plenipotentiary Conferences, and where appropriate, the decisions of other conferences and meetings of the Union.</p>

<p>The Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ali Ibrahim (Pantami), is very excited to hear of the remarkable contribution of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector to Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the second quarter of 2022 (Q2 2022). The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) stated this in the ‘Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product Report’ for Q2 2022, released on the 26th of August, 2022.</p>



<p>The Digital Economy sector under Professor Pantami has continued its trend of playing a key part in the growth on Nigeria’s economy. The Report by the NBS indicated that the ICT sector contributed 18.44% to the total real GDP in Q2 2022. This is the highest contribution of ICT to the GDP and is truly unprecedented and marks the third time that the sector has achieved an unprecedented contribution to Nigeria’s GDP during the tenure of the Honourable Minister- in Q1 2020, Q2 2021 and now Q2 2022.</p>



<p>The oil sector contributed 6.33% to the total real GDP in Q2 2022, which was lower than the contribution in Q2 &#8216;2021 and Q1 &#8216;2022, where it contributed 7.42% and 6.63% respectively. The non-oil sector&#8217;s contribution grew by 4.77% in real terms, resulting in a 93.67% contribution to the nation’s GDP in the Q2 &#8216;2022, higher than Q2 &#8216;2021 and Q2 &#8216;2022, where it contributed 92.58% and 93.37% respectively.</p>



<p>The Honorable Minister notes that the growing contribution of the ICT sector to the GDP is as a result of the commitment of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR to the development of the digital economy. The diligent implementation of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) for a Digital Nigeria, stakeholder engagement and creation of an enabling environment have all played an important role in this achievement.</p>



<p>The support of President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, has contributed immensely to the impressive developments in the sector. The unprecedented contribution of ICT to Nigeria’s GDP can also be attributed to the dynamic and results-oriented leadership of the sector. The GDP Report has shown how critical the ICT sector is to the growth of our country’s digital economy and, by extension, the general economy.</p>



<p>The Honourable Minister congratulates all stakeholders in the digital economy ecosystem for this cheering news. He also renews his call to all sectors to take advantage of the Federal Government’s new focus on the digital economy to enable and improve their processes through the use of ICTs. This would enhance the output of all the sectors of the economy and boost Nigeria’s GDP.</p>



<p>Dr Femi Adeluyi<br />Technical Assistant (Research and Development) to theHonourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy<br />27th August 2022</p>

<p>Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), says terrorists and bandits are denied access to telecommunication services with the ongoing implementation of National Identity Number, SIM linkage policy in Nigeria.</p>



<p>The Director, Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement NCC, Mr Ephraim Nwokonanya, represented by Head Compliance, Monitoring and Enforcement, NCC, Mr Alkasim Umar made this disclosure at the One-day Capacity Building for members of the Nigerian Information Technology Reporters’ Association (NITRA), Abuja Chapter on Thursday at the Commission Headquarters, Abuja.</p>



<p>According to him, “Yes we are making progress. The only challenge we are faced with now is, If they kidnap you, I mean the bandits; they use your number to call. They will never use their phones lines, it is the kidnapped person’s phone number they use to call and switch it off immediately. They can keep you at a different place and make somewhere else. If a phone is off, there is no way one can trace it. It’s a big challenge.</p>



<p>“Even in the National Assembly someone brought this up, to ban all kidnappers lines, some people objected, that if they use a person number to make calls why can’t Federal Government block the terrorists/bandits phone numbers. Then someone rose up to say there will be more killings, this is because kidnappers are after victims’ money so there is no way it will curb the problem. But now there is progress, because they are being denied of SIM cards”, he stated.</p>

<p>The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Pantami, has underscored the significance of building more mosque as a centre for the integration and advance of Islam and Muslim community in the country.</p>



<p>He said that historically, mosque had played a significant role in the development of Islamic Culture and Education, adding that the first University to be established in the world started from a mosque.</p>



<p>“The second University to be established globally also originated from a mosque. Similarly, the first University and first Degree Awarding institution in the world was the University of al-Qarawiyyin in Morocco.</p>



<p>“It was followed by the University of Al Azhar in Cairo, Egypt, both of them originated from a mosque. This is to show us that mosque is not only where we converge and pray five daily prayers, but a mosque is supposed to be a centre of learning, centre for child upbringing, uniting Muslims and a centre for guidance and counseling.</p>



<p>“Also, a mosque is a place where Muslims are taught good moral behavior and it is a place for economic development and so on.”</p>

<p>The Pantami-led delegation equally met with the representatives of the World Economic Forum (WEF) to explore and concretely engage about opportunities within the framework of the EDISON Alliance for Digital Inclusion, and the possibility of Nigeria becoming Lighthouse Country of the Alliance.</p>



<p>EDISON Alliance was launched by WEF to mobilise a global movement to prioritize digital inclusion as foundational to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This is envisioned to enhance attainment of goals towards fostering affordable and accessible digital opportunities for everyone by 2025.</p>



<p>One significance of the deliberations with WEF is the readiness to leverage relationship with EDISON Alliance to accelerate and foster unprecedented collaboration between the ICT community and other critical sectors of the economy in order to advance Nigeria&#8217;s vision on financial inclusion.</p>



<p>Indeed, on March 1, 2022, the Nigerian delegation is also scheduled to discuss with the MTN team, and thereafter proceed to attend a demo at Meta’s Exhibition Stand, where the CEO of Meta and owner of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, is to call for global partnership to build the next world virtual reality (metaverse). A metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection.</p>



<p>On March 2, 2022, the Nigerian delegation will meet a United States (US) delegation to discuss collaboration on telecommunications and related ICT issues. The Nigerian delegation will also engage the exhibition by Huawei Technologies as well as chat with the company’s senior executive management.</p>



<p>Speaking at the influential, global technology congress, Pantami said “The high-level discussion which Nigerian delegation is having with both original equipment manufacturers and other key players in the ICT world will enhance deeper alliance, collaboration and bilateral synergy required to accelerate Nigeria’s vision for a real digital economy.”</p>



<p>Amplifying the Minister’s voice, Danbatta said Nigeria’s participation at the event on an annual basis is based on the realistaion that “MWC provides a vibrant deal-making environment for attendees, as it also remains a truly international exhibition attracting decision-makers in the mobile ecosystem which Nigeria is keen to explore to grow its telecoms and ICT industry.”</p>



<p>The 2022 MWC is being attended by mostly senior executives and management staff of over 2000 companies, institutions and entities from 183 countries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>By Farooq Kperogi</p>



<p>I normally don’t read, much less respond to, anything Femi Fani-Kayode writes because he’s clearly an emotionally and psychologically disturbed man whom I once described in an October 7, 2006 column titled “Fani-Kayode: Ministerial Rascality Taken Too Far!” as an “ignorant, rascally, and harebrained twerp,” as “a vulgar, noisy, bigoted, foul-mouthed, infantile, and witless twit,” and as a “drab, vain, sycophantic, overzealous, scatterbrained megalomaniac” who is “the very personification of ethnic and religious bigotry.”</p>



<p>Fani-Kayode, the vilest and most vicious Islamophobe in Nigeria until APC (which he’d called a “Janjaweed” party) fixed its metaphoric feeding bottle in his hungry and greedy mouth and who as recently as April 22, 2021 called Pantami a “cold-blooded beast” and a “religious bigot, an ethnic supremacist, an unrepentant jihadist, a lover of bloodshed, carnage and terror and a psychopathic and clearly insane induvidual [sic] who may well have been responsible for the slaughter of many innocent Christians over the years as a consequence of his inflammatory rhetoric and reckless actions,” now says ASUU is opposing Pantami’s professorial fraud “because he is a Muslim.” Ha!</p>



<p>If there is one person who is almost singlehandedly responsible for calling attention to Pantami’s professorial fraud and making it a fixture in the public imagination, it is I, whom Pentecostal Christian fanatics (whom I like to call Talibangelicals) and unreflective Yoruba ethnic chauvinists have called a “jihadist” for pushing the oppression of Yoruba Muslims to the forefront of national consciousness.</p>



<p>Has Fani-Kayode said anything about the symbolic tyranny against Yoruba Muslims in Yorubaland since he now suddenly loves Muslims? Well, there’s no feeding bottle for defending them, so…</p>



<p>With a few exceptions, almost every academic who has pointed out Pantami’s professorial fraud is a Muslim and a northerner: I, Professor Abdulsamad Umar Jibia, Dr. Abdelghaffar Amoka Abdelmalik, Dr. Nasir Mansir, Dr. Ali Abubakar Sadiq, etc. The chairman of the ATBU branch of ASUU by the name of Dr. Inuwa Ibrahim who told newsmen that “from all indications, the [promotion of Pantami to professor] was shrouded in inadequacies” and is “a total disregard to academic excellence” is a Muslim and a northerner.</p>



<p>So, where does religion come in here? It is us “jihadists”—according to the twisted, immature rantings of Christian fanatics who want to be left alone in “peace” to oppress and tyrannize their Muslim brothers and sisters—who’re calling out our fellow “jihadist” for committing intellectual fraud. What business does a wretched, godforsaken Islamophobe like Fani-Kayode (who should be nicknamed MONA, i.e., Most Obnoxious Nigerian Alive) have with that?</p>



<p>Fani-Kayode, who has never worked in academia, who knows next to nothing about the conventions and protocols of promotions in the university, ignorantly said Pantami is “eminently qualified to be a Professor.”</p>



<p>If Fani-Kayode weren’t the two-bit, scatterbrained, narcotized, mercenary thug that he is, he would’ve known that Pantami hasn’t met even the most basic requirement to be recruited as a professor at FUTO. All FUTO job ads for the position of a professor, which can be found on their website, require “a doctorate degree…plus a minimum of 12 years post qualification experience in teaching and research in a university.”</p>



<p>Pantami got his PhD in 2014, that is, about 7 years ago. That is 5 years short of the “minimum of 12 years post qualification experience” the job ad requires. Plus, Pantami’s entire university teaching record is less than 10 years&#8211; if you consider that he didn’t teach during the three years he studied for his PhD at the Robert Gordon University in Scotland.</p>



<p>Similarly, his PhD is in management from the business school of Robert Gordon University. It is not in cybersecurity. People can become professors in fields they didn’t get their PhD in if they publish extensively in them. But Pantami’s record of just 10 mostly low-quality, pay-to-play, garbage-in-garbage-out publications in fraudulent, predatory journals doesn’t compensate for his management PhD.</p>



<p>Most importantly, though, Pantami is a federal minister who cannot, by law, accept another appointment, whether or not he is paid for it. The only other job the law allows him to do is farming</p>



<p>Pantami is my brother and friend, and he KNOWS why I’m exposing his fraud. He himself once told me during a chat that he’d come to terms with the fact that I embody the fiercely brutal truth-telling qualities of Umar ibn al-Khattab after whom my father (who was an Arabist and Islamic Studies teacher) named me. Umar’s nickname was Farooq, which literally means one who distinguishes truth from falsehood.</p>



<p>Fani-Kayode is only Pantami’s “friend in fraud.” He is in it for the feeding bottle. What fraud has joined together, let no religion put asunder!</p>

<p>By Yusuf Abubakar</p>



<p>The effort of positioning Nigeria’s digital economy sector on the path of sustainable National development, companioned by the leader of the sector, the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami has once more being brought to the spotlight as Dr Pantami was today conferred with the DIGITAL ECONOMY DRIVER AWARD.</p>



<p>The accolade was presented by the National Body of Nigeria Information Technology Reporters Association (NITRA) to the Minister in his office during a familiarization visit to introduce its New Excos.</p>



<p>The award according to NITRA, an advocacy group was in recognition of the Honourable Minister’s effort in harnessing and formulating policies to drive Nigeria to gainful digitization as captured in the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy for a Digital Nigeria.</p>



<p>The NITRA team also commended the Minister for coming up with people-oriented developmental policies and overseeing implementation.

<p>Mr President said, “I commend the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim (Pantami), for the landmark achievements of the digital economy sector and his commitment in carrying out his responsibility of developing the sector, including championing the growth of the indigenous telecom sector and NIN-SIM registration process. I also commend the industry stakeholders for their support for the sector”.</p>

<p>Aisha Yusufu, Nigerian female activist has given the reason why she will not link her phone line with national identification number (NIN).</p>



<p>The activist who speak via her Twitter handle said that she rather stay without having phone line than to have her information in the hands of terrorist sympathizers.</p>



<p>Aisha in tweet with hashtag #PantiMustGo which demands the sacking or resignation of the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami.</p>



<p>Said “Let me repeat categorically what I have said before. I WILL NOT BE LINKING MY NIN to my phone number! I will rather not have a phone line than willingly give my information and have it in the control of a terrorist sympathiser and his cohorts #PantamiMustGo,” Yesufu tweeted.</p>



<p>The call for Pantami’s sacking or resignation is a result of a sermon he delivered in the past which had him allegedly sympathising with terrorist groups – Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.</p>



<p>However Nigerian government under the leadership of president muhammadu buhari has backed Pantami.</p>



<p>Statement by Garba Shehu in regards to the call for the resignations of Pantami stated that pantami has apologised for her wrong statement.</p>



<p>Reacting through a video in April, Yesufu said, “The Presidency is not Garba Shehu and Muhammadu Buhari. The Presidency is an institution and that institution should never be seen in any way whatsoever supporting someone who is now known to have been a terrorist sympathiser.<br /><br />“We cannot be a nation that allows people who support terrorism to be out there in our public domain as public servants. We cannot have a minister of a sector that is so sensitive – as per our information, everything under that sector – be someone who is a terrorist sympathiser, whether has been, still is, repented or not.”</p>
