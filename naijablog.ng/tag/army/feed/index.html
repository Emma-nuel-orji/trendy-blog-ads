<p>The impostors who were paraded to the media 13 March 2024 at Headquarters 81 Division NA, Victoria Island Lagos were identified as, Mr. Abua Jacob, Mr. Solomon Abraham, Mr. Mohammed Jemilu, Mr. Michael Omieh, Mr. Dauda Samuel, Mr. Bida Musa, Miss Esther Audu, and Miss Vivian Titus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="678" height="451" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17104337579535662288224375070019.jpg?resize=678%2C451&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-145667" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17104337579535662288224375070019.jpg?w=721&amp;ssl=1 721w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fb_img_17104337579535662288224375070019.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>These suspects have been arrested for various offenses, including illegal duties, providing illegal security, and illegal escort services while donning military uniforms.

<p>The General Officer Commanding 81 Division NA, Major General Mohammed Takuti Usman, has urged law-abiding citizens in Lagos and6 Ogun States to remain vigilant and report suspicious activities. He reassured the public that concerted efforts, in collaboration with other security agencies, will continue to ensure that such criminal elements are denied a comfort zone within the Division&#8217;s Area of Responsibility.</p>



<p>The suspects will be handed over to the Nigerian Police for further investigation and prosecution in accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>



<p>The Nigerian Army remains resolute in its commitment to ensuring the safety and security of citizens within its jurisdiction and will continue to take decisive action against individuals impersonating service personnel and other criminal elements.</p>

<p>The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Christopher Musa, has revealed that military personnel are paid N50,000 as monthly salary while he and other officers, regardless of rank, are paid N1,200 daily as operation allowance.</p>



<p>He disclosed this while speaking about the welfare of soldiers on Channels TV on Tuesday. “The issue of cash allowance where we feed, any time we are on operations, I as a General, I am being paid N1,200 per day with my soldiers. From the first general to the last soldier, it is the same amount; that is what we manage.</p>



<p>My soldiers collect less than N50,000 as salary in a month. We all know the situation on the ground; my appeal is for them to have a salary that is worthy of the work they are doing; we deserve to have that so that it can encourage them to want to do more,” he said.</p>



<p>He, therefore, called for an increase in soldiers’ salaries, as they deserve to be paid more for the work they do, adding that although an average of 15,000 personnel has been recruited over the years, there has been no corresponding increase in the number of barracks.</p>



<p>He said, “If you look at the constitution, our primary responsibility is territorial integrity but if you look at the territorial integrity, it implies that charity begins at home. We can not be protecting territory and the home front is on fire and then sit back and watch.</p>



<p>“Over the past few years, on average, the armed forces recruited over 15,000 personnel into the system, but we are not building new barracks. We know budget has captured some of it, we need to do more, we need to renovate the old ones because they have been there for ages. My dream is for every officer and soldier to have an accommodation that he can look up and say, this is my own, this is my barracks. Because of the operations we are conducting, a lot of the officers and soldiers are out there in the field. If to say these operations are over and we too are to go back to the barracks, there wouldn’t be enough barracks for us.”</p>

<p>The Nigerian Army says it will take a minimum of 30 years to eradicate the Islamic terrorist group, Boko Haram.</p>



<p>According to Tribune, the Acting Director of Nigerian Army Information Management, Brig-Gen. Folorunso Oyinlola disclosed this in Benin at the 22nd Edition of Social Media Seminar on Civil-Military Relations.</p>



<p>Oyinlola said it will take a new generation of Northeasterners with education and the right orientation for the militancy to be completely wiped out.</p>



<p>The deputy military spokesman said the new generation will have to be educated and re-oriented before Nigeria can truly declare victory against Jihadism and terrorism.</p>



<p>Oyinlola said, “Insurgency is not something that can be filtered away with the snap of a finger. The insurgents live with us. We can’t bomb the whole of Edo State under the guise of fighting Boko Haram.</p>



<p>“We’ll need a minimum of 30 years to be able to defeat the Boko Haram. We will need a new generation of Northeasterners who will have to be educated for us to declare that we have defeated Boko Haram.”</p>



<p>He said the civil war in Libya which is yet to be resolved has led to the destabilisation of the West African subregion as lots of weapons have poured in from the North African country, exacerbating the security situation in Nigeria and elsewhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The allegation that soldiers of the Nigerian Army(NA)are proceeding on voluntary retirement due to alleged corruption, poor service conditions and low morale as recently reported by some media outfits in the social media is nothing but a concoction of the imagination of the unrepentant enemies of the nation and mischief makers and should be outrightly discountenanced by the public.</p>



<p>The subjective and unethical report is a distraction and another failed attempt at dampening the morale and fighting will of the loyal, dedicated and patriotic fighting force of the NA.</p>



<p>Perhaps these impenitent mischief makers need to be schooled to understand that the NA is not a conscript Army and that recruitment into the NA is voluntary with extant policy on discharge and retirement of soldiers and officers respectively, like other organizations. This provides its personnel the opportunity to apply for voluntary discharge, when they deem fit and meet the terms and conditions as<br />stipulated in the Harmonized Terms and Conditions of Service soldiers/ratings/airmen (Revised) 2017. It is thus, the inalienable right of a personnel to voluntarily or on medical grounds apply for discharge, if they meet the terms. It is therefore not an aberration that the COAS granted approval for 91 NA/32/4792 WO NDAGANA ISHIAKU and 242 others to voluntarily discharge from the NA, as being unprofessionally manipulated by some media.</p>



<p>Given the pedigree and mannerism of the publisher of the ill-fated report, it is clear, that it is targeted at deflating the high morale of troops by downplaying recent critical interventions by the COAS Lt Gen Faruk Yahaya on troops&#8217; welfare, which include car loans, housing loans, extensive construction of new accomodation, massive renovation of old and dilapidated accomodation, building of befitting residences and issuing of vehicles to Regimental Sergeant Majors, scholarship awards to children and wards of fallen heroes and other unique interventions in the theatres of operation to sustain the heightening morale of troops. These interventions evidently account for troops&#8217; game changing onslaught in the NothEast.</p>



<p>It must also be mentioned, that the quantum of equipment that have been injected into the theatres and prompt payment of operational allowances, have all turned the tide against the insurgents. Also worthy of note is the welfare flight for troops, which has significantly reduced the burden of troops travelling in and out of the theatres, in addition to huge commitment on the medical needs of wounded-in-action soldiers and the barracks communities. Equally important, is the fact that troops are now being regularly and consciously rotated from the frontline, hence, issues of overstay and battle fatigue are gradually being overcome. Suffice to say, that some of these recently discharged soldiers are beneficiaries of these giant strides.</p>



<p>The COAS, once again congratulates the discharging personnel for their gallantry, patriotism, loyalty and courage while in service and wishes them the very best as they successfully exit active service from the NA. He also reiterates his avowed determination to continue to have direct impact on the welfare and wellbeing of both serving and retired personnel. He is also assuring the retirees that soon, their various commanders would organise a farewell luncheon in their honour, as it is the practice in the NA since Gen Yahaya took over command.</p>
