<p>President Bola Tinubu, on Tuesday, said his administration was prioritising and improving Nigeria’s health sector through massive investments and an increased allocation of funds to the sector in the proposed 2024 budget.</p>



<p>He, therefore, appealed to Nigerian health workers practising abroad to “sacrifice their time to come back home and serve their people.”</p>



<p>This was as he implored countries poaching Nigerian health workers to consider the interest of Nigeria.</p>



<p>Tinubu made the call on Tuesday at the unveiling of Nigeria’s Health Sector Renewal Investment Initiative at the State House, Abuja.</p>

<p>It seem that President Ahmed Bola Tinubu government is not ready to free the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB Nnamdi Kanu as today court sitting quashed his Acquittal and order his trial for treason and terrolism.</p>



<p>The development is coming today morning after the court upheld federal government treason and terrolism charge against the castrated IPOB leader.</p>



<p>Kanu who is demanding for the republic of Biafra for Igbos speaking tribes of Nigeria, was arrested and brought back to Nigeria few years back, after he narrowly escaped from his house following federal government force visit.</p>



<p>The visit where said to have cost many life.</p>



<p>Recently, before today sitting, IPOB write open letter to President Tinubu, to free Nnamdi Kanu if his agenda is not about ethnic cleansing.</p>



<p>However today judgment has proven that the government will not free the detained separatist leader.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The global family and movement of the Indigenous People of Biafra IPOB ably led by our Supreme leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu wish to draw the attention of the Nigeria government headed by President Ahmed Bola Tinubu that he and his government have the opportunity to prove to Ndigbo that he is not pursuing an ethnic cleansing agenda by releasing Mazi Nnamdi KANU from illegal detention by the DSS in the coming days or through the pronouncement of the Apex Court of Nigeria.</p>



<p>Ndigbo at home and diaspora are waiting to welcome Mazi Nnamdi Kanu home this December for the Christmas celebration. Whether Nigeria believes it or not, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is the face of Biafra, and Ndigbo nation. His pains are the pains of Biafra, and his joy is the joy of Biafra. The only people who despise Mazi Nnamdi Kanu are the criminals, the kidnappers, the insecurity profiteers, the enemies of peace, and all the enemies of Biafran nation and even Nigeria. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu controls millions of followers across the globe. His lovers and supporters will be very happy if the government of President Tinubu releases him unconditionally on or before the 15th of December 2023.</p>



<p>It will be ironic that the Nigerian President Ahmed Bola Tinubu and the Supreme Court Justices will hide under the pretence that some interested persons do not want Mazi Nnamdi Kanu released or hide under the bogus claims of National security risk as an excuse not to release MaziNnamdiKanu. As long as the world is concerned, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is not a national security threat to Nigeria. He and IPOB have been peaceful, and that is why more than 100 Nations of the world authorized the IPOB movement in their countries. Moreso, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has not committed any crime known to law anywhere, nor has any IPOB member been convicted of any crime in any Nigeria Court. We keep reminding the Nigeria government and the international community of the consequences of condoning ethnic cleansing and persecution of Ndigbo because we call for Biafra&#8217;s self-determination.</p>



<p>The eyes of the world are on the Supreme Court Justices of Nigeria. Not only Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will be on trial on December 15, 2023, but the Nigeria Supreme Court, UN law on Self-determination, African Charter on Human and People&#8217;s Right, and International laws on Extradition will also be on trial. The Nigeria Supreme Court will either save the Nigeria Judiciary&#8217;s battered image by going by the rule of law on December 15, 2023 or bend to the pressure from men of selfish interest and slide Nigeria into anarchy by endorsing illegality and keeping Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in detention.</p>



<p>Moreso, if President Ahmed Bola Tinubu allows himself to be used by saying some people from the Southeast advised him not to release Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, that means he has outsourced his authority and lacks power as the President of Nigeria.</p>



<p>Mazi Nnamdi Kanu deserves to be a free man after the Abuja Federal Court of Appeal discharged and acquitted him. The same Appeal Court barred the federal government of Nigeria from arresting or prosecuting him any longer in any court in Nigeria. The then lawless government refused to obey the Appeal Court Orders. Instead, they appealed and got a black market stay of execution. We hope that the Nigeria&#8217;s Supreme Court Justices will <em>not</em> ignore the government&#8217;s disobedience to Appeal Court Orders during their judgment to prove their honor and Independence. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and IPOB members have never committed any crime known to law locally or internationally.</p>



<p>The Supreme Court Justices should do Nigeria and themselves a favor by releasing Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Posterity will be kind to the Justices, who will do the needful and release Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, a prisoner of conscience. The release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will restore peace in the Eastern Region and give joy to Ndigbo and all Biafrans. But, his continuous persecution and illegal detention will further endanger the safety and security of Nigeria and, in particular, the entire Biafran territory. Biafrans at home and diaspora are keenly awaiting and watching the Supreme Court Justices.</p>

<p>Presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu promised to break the shackle of poverty and destitution in Nigeria.</p>



<p>Tinubu made the pledge while speaking at the inauguration of the Tinubu-Shettima Women Presidential Campaign Team at the State House Banquet Hall, Presidential Villa, Abuja on Monday.</p>



<p>The former Lagos governor informed the audience that the symbol on his cap means “broken shackle.”</p>



<p>“The design on this cap is a broken shackle. We are breaking the shackle of poverty and destitution. In the last eight years, it has been a party that inherited a troublesome nation under the weight of uncertainty.</p>



<p>“We took over the worst pricing of crude oil but still, the very determined, focused person (Buhari) was able to bail 36 states of this country which were not able to pay salaries,” he added.</p>



<p>Tinubu also knocked out the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party, saying they will never rule again.</p>



<p>“A nation is not built on abusive language… 16 years of rudderless and ditching the wool – PDP shall never come back again. Never again.</p>



<p>“Our opponents spent 16 years, they had forgotten that the highway is an economy, electricity is mandatory for industrialization. They don’t understand the transmission lines and the need for maintenance.</p>



<p>“They couldn’t make a down payment for the rail track. They are a political party of termites,” he said.</p>



<p>Tinubu said he is a builder and knows what to do immediately after he claims victory in 2023.</p>



<p>He urged his supporters to go and tell the world he is a man that knows the way.</p>
