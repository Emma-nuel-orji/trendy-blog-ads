<p>A total of 56 people confirmed death in Zamfara State following the latest attacked by bandits terrorist</p>



<p>Naijablog gathered that the incident happened on Friday afternoon at about 2:30pm at Sabon Garin Damri village in Bakura Local Government Area of Zamfara State.</p>



<p> According to the report 56 people were killed while other sustained various degree of injuries..</p>



<p>Former councilor who speak to newsmen about the incident said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“I was in the main town when the bandits entered Sabon Garin Damri. We suddenly saw people running towards us. Then we started hearing sporadic gunshots. I was miraculously saved,” he said.</p></blockquote>



<p>He said the bandits carried out what appears to be coordinated attacks from Sabon Garin Damri, Damri and Kalahe before a joint security team confronted them.</p>



<p>Another resident, Mu’azu Damri, said the number of casualties would have been more if the security agents didn’t confront the bandits.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“I’ll have to personally applaud them (security agents), though I believe they should have come earlier because if they came at the right time, they would have saved a lot of people. But their arrival helped because the number would have been more than that,” he said</p></blockquote>



<p>Mr Damri also said the bandits were pursued by the team of soldiers and police personnel, forcing them to abandon the livestock, food items, and other things they had looted from residents.</p>

<p>Recover Arms, Ammunition, As IGP Harps on Technology-Driven Policing in Nigeria</p>



<p>Operatives of the Force Intelligence Bureau Intelligence Response Team (FIB-IRT), in a sting operation, have arrested four notorious arm dealers and recovered 57 AK47 rifles and a large catchment of ammunition in Jos, Plateau State and from other locations across the country. This is in furtherance of the IGP’s recent charge to the men of the Nigeria Police Force to be dauntless in the fight against crimes and criminality in the country.</p>



<p>The suspects, Hamza Zakari (aka Hamzo) aged 20yrs, Abubakar Muhammed (aka Fancy) aged 22yrs, Umar Ibrahim aged 25yrs and Muhammed Abdulkarim (aka Dan-Asabe) aged 37yrs, all males and residents of Jos, were arrested following a credible intelligence on their nefarious activities in Jos and its environs.</p>



<p>The suspects, who confessed to their involvement in arms dealings and other criminal acts, have been identified as one of the major links for the supply of arms and ammunition to criminal elements terrorizing the state and some other parts of the country. The investigation team is on the trail of their accomplices and they are closing in on them.</p>



<p>Similarly, operatives of the FIB-IRT acting on a tip-off have smashed and arrested three suspected gun runners in Ibi LGA of Taraba State. The suspects, Bello Sani, Venab Puncat and Yusuf Nahoda, all of Ibi Local Government Area of Taraba, during interrogation confessed to have purchased one AK47 rifle, and one SMG rifle at the cost of Nine Hundred Thousand Naira (#900,000). Concerted effort has been activated to arrest their collaborators and recover the exhibits.</p>



<p>The Inspector-General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, psc [+], NPM, fdc, while commending the successes recorded by the FIB-IRT, reassured members of the public of his administration&#8217;s commitment to the fight against common enemies of the nation who are hell-bent on causing pains, tears and agony to Nigerians. He also called for continuous support for the Police and the security community, as the Nigeria Police Force under his leadership will up its game to ensure public safety, peace and security via intelligence-led, technology–driven and robust community–based partnership for a better security architecture in Nigeria.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the arrested suspects will be arraigned in court upon conclusion of investigations.</p>

<p>A resident of the area Abdulrazak Ahmad blamed the incident on the evacuation and withdrawal of soldiers serving in a joint security task force from the area.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/fb_img_16472902280099049780191483104791.jpg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-105782" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>Ahmad said the withdrawn soldiers were initially stationed at the Government Secondary School in Shinfida – about 27 kilometres from Jibia town.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/fb_img_16472902306906108212191630417252.jpg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-105783" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>No fewer than 11 persons mostly elderly women were abducted by the gunmen while on their way to join other residents, who earlier ran to a refugee camp for safety after their village came under attack by a group of gunmen suspected to be bandits.</p>

<p>Notorious terrorist, Bello Turji has said the government cannot hinder illegal firearms in circulation nor can it prevent terrorists from buying petrol for their operations.</p>



<p>DAILY POST recalls that in Zamfara State in September 2021, restrictions were placed to minimize the activities of bandits in the state.</p>



<p>The notorious terrorist spoke with Trust TV in an interview as part of a documentary tagged, “Nigeria’s Banditry: The Inside Story”.</p>



<p>The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), however, had last year mandated all telecommunication operators in the country to stop extending services to Zamfara and its environs.</p>



<p>Many bandit leaders and their foot soldiers, during the restriction, were reported killed during several raids in the state.</p>



<p>According to Turji, “It is not right to deny Fulani entry into Shinkafi; it’s a local government for all citizens. If you deny Fulani entry, where are they supposed to go?”</p>



<p>He explained that if someone buys just a measure of maize, they confiscate it; or if he or she buys a loaf of bread they will say you are buying it for Turji, asking if it is only Turji who eats out of all the people here?</p>



<p>He assured that those who failed to prevent the circulation of arms in Nigeria would not prevent them from buying petrol, which even a little kid knows where it can be obtained.</p>
