<p>Nigerian comedian, basket mouth speak on how he feel when they accused wizkid of being proud.</p>



<p>In his explanation, </p>



<p>“All these talks about Wizkid being proud will always be funny to me. 2014 I had my show in Lagos and I really needed Wizkid to perform and I was willing to pay him anything.</p>



<p>I contacted him and he told not to bother about paying him. He promised to come as a surprise guest &amp; put up a show for free.</p>



<p>3 days to the event, Wizkid called me that he won’t be able to show up coz a very important family emergency had happened. I was really heartbroken but I just had to accept the reality. 35 minutes after that call, Wizkid asked me to contact any Nigerian artiste I will like to book for the event and get back to him with the bills. I quickly contacted Lil Kesh, Kcee, Yemi Alade and Phyno. The bill was about 40 Million Naira and Wizkid cleared it all. Mannn! I thought I was dreaming. Wizkid is not the guy social media keeps trying to make y’all believe he is” ~ Basket Mouth.</p>

<p>Nigerian Comedian, BasketMouth has react to the killing of David, sound engineer Lynch to death by Hausa Okada boys in Lekki phase 1 in Lagos State.</p>



<p>In a post share on his Facebook page, Basket Mouth said: </p>



<p>I only read &amp; hear about unbelievable and terrifying incidents like this and now it has hit so close to home.</p>



<p>David was a dedicated member of my church. He was innocent and did not deserve the horror he was dealt by this crazy mob that night. A father of two young children, a husband &amp; friend to many and he got beaten &amp; lynched in Lekki Phase 1. Lekki phase 1 is usually littered with several check points. It&#8217;s unbelievable that terror is right at our doorstep.</p>



<p>Thanks to efforts by many via social media &amp; news media. We have seen statements from authorities but much more needs to be done not only to bring #JusticeForDave but also to ensure this menacing wave of jungle justice, comes to a stop.</p>
