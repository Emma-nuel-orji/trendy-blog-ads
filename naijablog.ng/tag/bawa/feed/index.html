<p>A Second Prosecution Witness, PW2, in the trial of a former governor of Sokoto State Attahiru Bafarawa, Kassim Yusuf, on Tuesday, January 30, 2024, recounted before Justice Yusuf Halilu of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, High Court, Abuja, that the former governor diverted a staggering N4.6billion he received as security fund from the office of the former National Security Adviser, NSA, Colonel Sambo Dasuki.</p>



<p>The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, is prosecuting Bafarawa on amended 25-count charges bordering on criminal breach of trust and diversion of public funds to the tune of N4.6billion. Other defendants in the case are, Bashir Yuguda, Colonel Sambo Dasuki (rtd), Dalhatu Investment Limited and Sagir Attahiru.</p>



<p>Yusuf, an officer of the EFCC, who was led in evidence by the prosecution counsel, Rotimi Jacobs, SAN, informed the court that N4.6billion security funds received by Dalhatu Investment Limited from the Office of the former National Security Adviser, ONSA, Colonel Dasuki were used to sponsor Sokoto State indigenes on Muslim pilgrimage and finance Bafarawa’s 2015 presidency quest, as well as offset his overseas mortgage, and acquisition of expensive vehicles comprising Lexus, Toyota Hilux pickups and 16 Peugeot 206 cars for Peoples Democratic Party, PDP local government chairmen in the state.</p>



<p>The PW2 further revealed that N1bn was given out from the sum to about 10 Bureau De Change, BDC operators for conversion to dollars. “About 10 BDCs said Dalhatu Investment Limited sent somebody to collect the money and about N800 million was transferred to Dalhatu Investment Ltd’s domiciliary account to be converted to dollars. Funds were paid to a company called Development Strategy International Ltd. The directors of the company are Islam Wali and Muhammad Wali who are cousins to Ambassador Abdullahi Wali,” he said.</p>



<p>The witness further revealed that Ambassador Abdullahi Wali received the sum of N5580million from Dalhatu Investment Ltd, which Bafarawa released to him for his 2015 Sokoto State gubernatorial aspiration.</p>



<p>“The Lexus that was purchased was bought by Dalhatu Investment for Abdullahi Wali’s election. Muazu Madawaki who received N322million was also invited. He told the investigation team that the money was for payment for Umra and Hajj allowances, hotel accommodation and flight tickets for some Sokoto State pilgrims. Ahmed Yahya received N327million and when he was invited he said the money was for political activities. He is the personal assistant to Bafarawa. Ibrahim Maigana received N111million from Dalhatu Investment for political activities in Sokoto State. He was the Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, at that time. One Musa Soba received N85million on behalf of nine aspirants in the state for the House of Representatives&#8221;, he said.</p>



<p>The witness further informed the court that one Muhammad Gambol supplied the Toyota Hilux pickups and 16 Peugeot 206 for the political campaigns of Ambassador Wali.</p>



<p>&#8220;I recovered about 14 of those PDP local government chairmen&#8217;s cars. One Amanze Obi received the sum of N15.3million for political publicity for Alhaji Attahiru Bafarawa Presidential campaign. About £123,000 (One Hundred and Twenty-three Thousand Pounds) were transferred to the United Kingdom to offset a mortgage for Alhaji Attahiru Bafarawa. We wrote back to the National Security Adviser, Major General Muhammad Mungonu and he confirmed that the monies were simply diverted without executing the project,” he said.</p>



<p>After listening to the testimony of the witness, Justice Halilu adjourned the matter till April 14, 2024 for continuation of trial.</p>

<p>The Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crime Commission, EFC, Abdulrasheed Bawa, has disclose that the Commission is currently investigating Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC).</p>



<p>In his statement, Bawa said despite Tinubu is not holding any immunity for prosecution now, the investigation would take time.</p>



<p>According to Bawa: “You asked me a question earlier about arresting people before an investigation and now you are saying why didn’t we arrest Tinubu? Why didn’t you just say ‘arrest him’?</p>



<p>“Investigation is ongoing. When you are investigating matters like this, they don’t end in a day. Thousands of investigations are going on, on a daily basis.</p>



<p>“You understand? You know you are from the media. After you will say we are doing a media trial.”</p>



<p>Recall that many Nigerians has been calling for the prosecution of former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu over bullion van cited in his house during presidential election.</p>



<p>Since then, nothing has been done about the case.</p>

<p>Abdulrasheed Bawa, chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Thursday, said he cannot publicly mention those financing Boko Haram and other terrorism acts in Nigeria.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Earlier in the week, authorities of the United Arab Emirates listed six Nigerians among those funding terrorism. Asked about those funding terrorism in Nigeria on Channels TV, Mr Bawa said he cannot discuss a sensitive national security issue on national television.</p>



<p>“If you are my adviser will you advise me to come on national television to tell the whole world regarding matters of sensitive national security issue?,” Mr Bawa asked. “Certainly, not. But what I want to assure you we are working tirelessly with other sister agencies to ensure that this country is free of terrorism.”</p>



<p>The Nigerian government had promised to publish names of those financing terrorism in the country. But has not kept its promise.</p>



<p>The Boko Haram insurgency has continued to ravage the country’s northeast corridor for more than a decade. While bandits have been deploying military-grade hardware to counter military offensive across the northwest.</p>

<p>The Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa has reiterated his commitment to sanitize the banking sector saying that any bank which allows itself to be used for fraud or money laundering shall be held liable.</p>



<p>Bawa stated this in a paper entitled, `Security, Trust and Leadership Effectiveness’, presented at the 14th annual Banking and Finance Conference of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) on 14th September, 2021 at Transcorp Hilton Hotel Abuja.</p>



<p>The EFCC boss who was represented by Abiodun Adebanjo, Head of Research Unit, Department of Policy, Research and Statistics restated the Commission&#8217;s determination to ensure that bank officials comply with regulations regarding assets declaration.</p>



<p>He urged financial institutions to embrace transformational leadership and technology which are imperatives for customer security and satisfaction.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to conclude by saying that we must be partners in progress because combating cybercrime requires effective collaboration among relevant public and private institutions, that’s why the EFCC will continue to collaborate with the CBN and the banks in ensuring the security and integrity of the financial system using all the laws that empowers us in dealing with cyber threats,” he said</p>

<p>The Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa, has advocated collective and collaborative approach by authorities around the world in dealing with the challenges of financial crimes which, he noted, is a global scourge as no nation is spared its virulence.</p>



<p>Bawa’s views are contained in a keynote address which he presented today, September 6, 2021 at the 38th Cambridge International Symposium on Economic Crime, themed, “Economic Crime-Who pays and who should pay?”, organized by the Center for International Documentation on Organized and Economic Crime (CIDOEC), Jesus College, University of Cambridge,, United Kingdom.</p>



<p>According to him, economic crimes which are largely illegal acts committed for private gain, “affect the vital structures of global economies, causing significant damage to the Global Financial System and depriving developing nations ofthe needed resources for sustainable development”.</p>



<p>He noted that developed countries are not immune from the scourge, which has “magnified with the proliferation of Cyber-crimes which threatens the stability of Global Financial Institutions.”</p>



<p>Bawa pointed out that new typologies of economic crimes such as the growth of cryptocurrencies, “portray a far greater danger to the world economy, ” as “criminals now elect to transact or receive illegal monies (such as ransom money) for cyber-attacks in Cryptocurrencies with Bitcoin and Ethereum as the most commonly used medium of these exchanges.”</p>



<p>He commended the choice of theme which he said offers a platform to interrogate the challenges of economic crimes. “As the victims of crime continue to suffer globally from the effects of financial crimes, either directly or indirectly as part of a social system, the determination of who pays or who should pay becomes a critical measure of the criminal justice system in place,” he said.</p>



<p>He underlined the imperatives of an impartial judiciary in ensuring that “the perpetrators of acts and not the victims pay for their crimes.”</p>



<p>While highlighting some of the transparency and accountability achievements of the Nigerian Government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari including enactment and amendment of relevant laws to enhance public accountability and reforms such as Treasury Single Account and the Whistle Blower Policy among others; Bawa pointed out that the EFCC, as the rallying point in the fight against economic crimes in Nigeria, has recorded important milestones in investigations, prosecutions and assets recovery.</p>



<p>In his words, “Since its establishment in 2003, the Commission has recorded no less than 3,500 convictions and recovered assets of significant value including properties in Nigeria, the UK, USA, and the UAE. All these have measurably contributed to the national efforts against economic crimes in Nigeria”.</p>



<p>The EFCC boss concluded by challenging participants to come up with practical solutions to curb the international threat of economic crimes.</p>



<p>The Chairman of the Symposium, Mr. Saul Froomkin, thanked the EFCC boss for his insightful presentation, and the support received from Nigeria in organizing the event.</p>



<p>Participants at the Symposium were drawn from law enforcement and security agencies, accountability institutions and select stakeholders from across the World</p>
