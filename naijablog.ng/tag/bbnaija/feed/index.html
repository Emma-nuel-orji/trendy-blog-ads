<p>BBN’s disqualified housemate and former miss Nigeria, Beauty Tukura, is not a lawyer as claimed, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) has said.</p>



<p>The NBA said this in a statement on Monday, August 8, a day after Beauty was disqualified from the show for being violent, The Nigeria Lawyer is reporting.</p>



<p>According to the report, the 1st Vice President, John Aikpokpo-Martin Esq in the statement said, “My attention and I guess of a large number of lawyers in Nigeria have been drawn to news reports that one Beauty Tukura, who is claimed and/or claims to be a lawyer participated and also got ignominiously disqualified from the on-going Big Brother Naija reality show “for throwing her wig and glasses at” a co-participant in the show after a party.</p>



<p>These reports have been very embarrassing to most members of the legal profession and may in all reasonable probability bring the profession into disrepute if found to be true. A quick check of the databases of the Roll of Legal Practitioners kept in the Supreme Court and the Nigerian Bar Association failed to reveal the name “Beauty Tukura” to be on the Supreme Court Roll or to be a member of the Nigerian Bar Association.</p>



<p>However, I hereby appeal to anyone who may be aware of her true name assuming we may have gotten her real name wrong to reach out to me.”</p>

<p>An inscription on the back of a hooded jacket worn by Eloswag, the first Head of house of the Level Up season of the Big Brother Naija reality TV show, has garnered reactions on social media.</p>



<p>Eloswag wore a hooded jacket with the inscription, ‘Be Obedient and Useful’.</p>



<p>Although the inscription is not spelt the way supporters of the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi spell it, the message was got.</p>



<p>Some tweeps have reacted saying that Eloswag would definitely remain in the house till the last day.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FB_IMG_1659032575164-630x630.jpg?resize=630%2C630&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-117741" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>Drpenking said “Eloswag, the current HOH has a message for all Nigerians. Guys, I said that we can hijack this BBNaija and use it in our favour. This is the beginning.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another tweep, Chude said, “Okay, this is him! Eloswag, Obidients favourite! He is winning it right? Na who support Obi we go support! Strategy or not, we have felled (sic) for it.”</p>



<p>Ukange David reacting to Eloswag said, “The biggest and most impactful thing I have seen so far from BBNaija. Eloswag “BE OBEDIENT And Useful.”</p>
