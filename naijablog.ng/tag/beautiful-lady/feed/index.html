<p>The young lady, who is proud of the feat in a Facebook post on Thursday, June 30, recalled some of the challenges she’s had to face because of her resolve to keep her chastity.<br />She claims that she has had a lot of failed relationships in the past because she refused to be intimate. She acknowledged that remaining a virgin is difficult, and that she occasionally feels tempted to give in, but the Lord gives her strength.</p>



<p>“Being a virgin at 21yrs it hasn’t been easy. A lot of temptations And losing relationships. Sometimes I just want to open my legs but am strong in the lord, he said thy shall not commit fornicate”. She wrote.</p>
