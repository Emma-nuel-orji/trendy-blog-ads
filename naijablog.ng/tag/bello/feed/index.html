<p>Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello has directed the suspension of the Ohi of Eganyi and Chairman, Ajaokuta Traditional Area Council, HRH Alhaji Musa Isah Achuja with immediate effect.</p>



<p>In a letter to the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Kogi State, the governor also directed that the Chairman of Ajaokuta Local Government Area, Hon Mustapha Aka’aba be queried over the breach and should reply within 24 hours.</p>



<p>The governor’s directive against the affected persons is in connection with the recent security breach in the area which led to the untimely deaths of some security personnel on their legitimate engagements of maintaining law and orders.</p>



<p>The governor strongly warned other traditional rulers across the state who may have connection in one way or the other with criminal elements in their domains to desist forthwith, saying that his administration will delt ruthlessly with anybody who romances with criminal elements no matter how highly placed they are.</p>

<p>Deji Adeyanju react to Photo of his state governor, Yahaya Bello seating as he look confused in the midst of his APC folk.</p>



<p>In his reaction, Deji said:</p>



<p>Yahaya Bello realizing he has been scammed.<br />He looks so sad. I feel like consoling him. Billions that should have been used to pay salaries and develop our state wasted on a childish act of playing in the sand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/screenshot_20220605-105340393710381904125252-561x630.jpg?resize=561%2C630&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-113516" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello is one of the Presidential Aspirant of the All Progressive Congress, APC.</p>



<p>Before now, the governor is optimistic that he will take over from President Muhammadu Buhari as Nigeria President come 2023.</p>



<p>He however has been screened for the primary, But they way is going now, he will not smell 10 position in the primary schedule to commence tomorrow.</p>

<p>What a joke!!!</p>



<p>Otami go and pay salary first before you talk to me <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60f.png" alt="😏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60f.png" alt="😏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60f.png" alt="😏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Road we no get, light is a joke, water is already a mission impossible for Abdulmumin Danga, hunger is becoming a normal thing in KC, civil servants are receiving four thousand naira as salary, educational sector is a no go area, and somebody is there hyping and praising the governor as if he doing well.<br />With due respect sir, you are not doing well at all.</p>



<p>The people that will sue you if you don&#8217;t run for president are the people that looted and suck the treasure of Kogi state under your watch as the state Governor. They want to make their way to the national treasure and finish what they started. Other than that, nobody is asking you to run for president sir.</p>



<p>Kogi state is not doing well at all, and somebody will start posting pictures of road constructions that are not up to 8km put together. I think you people need to go to Port Harcourt and learn a thing or two on infrastructures.</p>



<p>All of you should getaat <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f6b6-1f3fd-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="🚶🏽‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f6b6-1f3fd-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="🚶🏽‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f6b6-1f3fd-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="🚶🏽‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>After making mouth that he will win Nigerian hands down in 2023 Presidential elections, he only win 6% on the online poll created by channel televisions on Twitter.</p>



<p>Kogi state governor alhaji yahaya Bello who was known to own his state workers salaries of up to 18 month has declared intention to contest for 2023 Presidential elections.</p>



<p>The news which was initially come out as a rumors has been confirmed by the governor which compare himself with Ahmed Bola Tinubu of Lagos State who Nigerians believe that has interest to run for 2023 presidency.</p>



<p>Bello in an interview with BBC Africa said that Bola Tinubu no his limit.</p>



<p>According to him Nigerian youth are the one calling him to contest for 2023 presidency.</p>



<p>And he vowed not to disappoint the youth.</p>



<p>But on the recent online poll conducted by channel televisions has proven that the youth are not interested in his interest to run the country from 2023 as a president.</p>



<p>The poll conducted gave him 6% of which some of the youth are still questioning there must be a fraud in that pool if not he wouldn&#8217;t have gotten up to 6%.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/img_20210516_070006_9975182186079297901145-288x630.jpg?resize=288%2C630&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-90454" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>Governor Bello has a track record of failed governance.</p>



<p>In his first term in office, he is known to own workers of above 18 months salaries which he always blame his predecessor, sometime he debunked the news that he did not own his own workers.</p>



<p>The recently the bridge constructed in his state by his administration only lasted for one week before collapse.</p>



<p>The governor who was embarrassed because of the incident says that the blame should goes to the contractor handling the work of which he vow deal with the contractor.</p>



<p>The governor during his second term elections in kogi state, he is known to use helicopter to spray bullets on the voters most especially on the area which he knows that he will not win the elections.</p>



<p>During his election government convoys were used to hijack ballot box.</p>



<p>In the election no fewer than 18 Youths were killed, but on channel television when the governor is speaking he described the violence as a pocket of violence that does not worth cancellations of the elections.</p>

<p>Recall that on October 26th 2019, Omokoshaban report on how groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of Idah-Agenebode bridge was flag off by Governor Yahaya Bello of  Kogi State.</p>



<p>The ceremony is an official declaration that the contract has been awarded, and work is expected to have commenced immediately.</p>



<p>The governor performed the groundbreaking ceremony during his second term campaign.</p>



<p>Since wass declare winner of the elections 2019, work is yet to commenced for the construction of the brigade.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/images-2021-01-17t1305215722067319980021147..jpg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-81902" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>Omokoshaban correspondent who visited the brigade on the 16th Saturday, January 2021, confirmed that not even a single gravel has been drop at the brigade as a sign of work to Begin soon.</p>



<p>One of the resident who speak with us, said the governor has deceived them to achieved his political gain.</p>



<p>But he said all hope is not lost, because the governor still have years to spend in office.</p>



<p>&#8220;He had deceived us, by now we expect work to have commenced for the construction of this brigade, but nothing, not even sand.</p>



<p>But all hope is not lost, because he still in office, maybe before his term expire he will start the work&#8221; Adejo said </p>



<p>Another person who speak on the development said &#8220;he flagged the Idah-Agenebode bridge over a year ago and a single tip of gravel is yet to be seen on site. It is laughable too see a legend of underperformance hawking his inefficiency in the name of presidential campaign. Yeye like his name.&#8221;</p>

<p>From Jide Orintunsin &#8211; Abuja </p>



<p>The governing All Progressives Congrees is poised to record tripple the current membership figure, as the party begins registration and re-validation exercise of party members on the 25th of January nationwide.</p>



<p>The Chairman of the party&#8217;s newly inaugurated Women, Youth and Physically Challenged Mobiliasation and Sensitisation Committee on the forth coming membership registration exercise and Governor of Kogi State, Alhaji Yahaya Bello disclosed this in Abuja on Tuesday.</p>



<p>Speaking shortly after inauguration, Governor Bello assured the party leadership of the resolve of his Committee to mobilise Nigerians to join the ruling party during the registration exercise.</p>



<p>According to him, &#8220;I want to assure that we shall move to the field immediately. We are going to swing into action. We are going to laise with every stakeholder within the party and across party lines. We are going to create serious awareness. We are going to educate Nigerian people about our great our party. We are going to sensitize the Nigerian people. We are going to mobilize and we are going to have membership of this party tripped if not quadrupled by the grace of God.&#8221;</p>



<p>The governor who commended the party leadership for shaping the party maintained that at the end of the registration and re-validation exercise, the ruling party will remain the party to beat in future elections.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the time we are done and all the registration of new members and revalidation of existing members are done in the country, APC will not just be the largest in Africa but we&#8217;re going to call on even the developed nations to come and learn from APC in Nigeria.&#8221;</p>



<p>Appealing to Nigerians to troop out and join the ruling party, Bello said APC and it&#8217;s leadership have open the flank for all to be part of the party.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mr. President opened the door through the Chairman of the party and the managers of the party where an opportunity has been created that all those who left the party before, those who are desirous of joining the party and those who are desirous of decamping from other political parties to APC, that window has been opened.&#8221;</p>



<p>Inaugurating the Committee, the Chairman of the party&#8217;s Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Governor Mai Mala Buni mandated it to ensure that no member of the party was exempted in the exercise.</p>



<p>Buni who pledged to give the Committee the needed support, charged them laise with various stakehokders at the state level in order to ensure an all inclusive and successful exercise.</p>



<p>He said the committee had a crucial and critical role to play in the membership registration and revalidation exercise which will commence soon.</p>



<p>&#8220;You are expected to mount rigorous sensitization programme to effectively mobilise every member of the Party especially women and youth to either revalidate their membership or register afresh.</p>



<p>&#8220;You should leave no stone unturned to ensure effective mobilization for every member to take advantage of this opportunity to register.&#8221;</p>



<p>Other members of the committee are Governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun as Vice Chairman and the Party&#8217;s Director of Organisation, Prof. Ussiju Medaner will serve as Secretary.<br>End.</p>
