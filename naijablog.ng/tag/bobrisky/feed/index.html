<p>Segun Runsewe, the Director-General of the National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAA), has asked the House of Representatives to give his council powers to go after organizers of Big Brother Nigeria over nudity in the reality TV show.</p>



<p>Runsewe, who made the call on Tuesday, October 4, also seek power to go after crossdressers like Bobrisky.</p>



<p>While appearing before an ad hoc committee investigating the duplication of ministries, departments and agencies, Runsewe stated that nudity as displayed by the organizer of the popular show is against the culture of Nigeria.</p>



<p>The DG stated that proper amendment of the council’s act will allow them to go after BBN organizers and crossdressers like Bobrisky.</p>



<p>“I am the first person who took Big Brother Nigeria to the NBC to report them because they were having… I took it up and Big Brother (organisers) tried to reach me and I told them that if the culture in other parts of the world is to be naked – nudity, etc., they should not bring it to Nigeria because our culture is rich and it respects the integrity of our country.</p>



<p>This honourable House just needs to empower us with just a legal framework and that nons£nse will stop,” he said.</p>

Fast forward to ur arrest in Dubai tonto, u insulted Dubai police cos you were drunk and high asf i tried my best to control you back then i couldn’t fast forward Dubai police locked ur ass up for good two days in their cell. Nobody knew where you were locked up. I was crying calling people i know in dubia to look for where you were locked up. After two days you were released and the police collected ur phone and weed they caught with you and charge you to court . I removed my SIM card and gave you my phone just to make sure you quickly post some pictures on ur page so that Stella and other blogs won’t laugh at us. I paid for our hotels bills feeding. We were stuck in Dubai for three months all ur mouth you had no one to save your ass. Even ur so called boyfriends then stop picking ur calls cos you were giving them so much headache i was the only soul who stood my you. Fast forward @olaidehair paid me then to influence for her she got angry and ask me to refund her cos i was with you in Dubai instead of doing her job i begged that lady to send some of hair for me dubia so i can be working since I was stocked in Dubai with you. I was with you for three months then you didn’t see as a bad friend fast forward you were wearing all my gowns i bought to wear in Lagos just because you didn’t come with enough cloths till now many are still with you. I have you 1m to add to fine Dubai police gave you for seeing you with weed. Fast forward tonto after two months ur rent in Abuja was due, ur estate payment was due, ur son needed some money to feed we agreed after the third month I will fly back to abj to sort those bills for you. I flew back to Abuja and I bob sorted all d bills for you. Even if i bob wrong you is Dow wat you fe supposed to pay me with ? YOU RE UNGRATEFUL that is no one man want to stay with you cos you are bitter. How many friends can do dis lent to support a friend don’t lie to urself.
