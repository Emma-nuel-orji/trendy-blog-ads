<p>There is tension in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, following the arrest of a suspected Boko Haram leader.</p>



<p>DAILY POST gathered that the suspected terrorist was arrested Saturday night by operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) in Ogun State.</p>



<p>Most residents of Abeokuta have now been thrown into a panic mood, as information about the arrest went viral within the State capital.</p>



<p>This is coming amidst rumour that terrorists are planning to attack some States in the South West.</p>



<p>On Sunday, a reliable source informed our correspondent that the suspected Boko Haram leader was arrested at Ijaye area of the metropolis.</p>



<p>The suspected terrorist was said to have initially tried to resist arrest before he later bowed to the superior power of the DSS operatives.</p>



<p>It was gathered that the Boko Haram leader had left Katsina for Abeokuta, where he was employed as a security guard.</p>

<p>Eight repentant Boko Haram fighters were on Monday killed after an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) exploded in the North East of the Bama Local Government Area of Borno State.</p>



<p>The men were said to have sneaked out of Bama to deal in scrap metals with some terrorists in a market known as ‘Daula’ on the outskirts of Goniri village before the incident happened.</p>



<p>The former terrorists, who were among the 1,000 reintegrated into the community and resettled at Government Girls Secondary School in Bama, received the scraps from some Boko Haram fighters hiding in Sambisa forest without knowing that an IED abandoned during a military offensive was among the items they were carrying.</p>



<p>Zagazola Makama, a counter-insurgency expert, reportedly got the information about the incident from an intelligence officer.</p>

<p>One of the Nigerian soldiers fighting in the ongoing counter-insurgency operations in the Northeast has expressed sadness over the recent attack on Kuje prison, during which hundreds of inmates including Boko Haram terrorists escaped.</p>



<p>According to him, Nigerian soldiers fighting Boko Haram now consider the terrorists as ‘Government Boys’, stressing that when you capture them, you do not have power to do anything to them.</p>



<p>He said in an exclusive interview with SaharaReporters, &#8220;Now there&#8217;s confusion in Maiduguri due to the recent jail break at Kuje prison. It will take the live of 6 &#8211; 8 soldiers to capture a single Boko-Haram alive face to face.</p>



<p>&#8220;And before they take such Boko Haram member to Abuja, he must be a high-profile terrorist. If not, the Boko Haram would be kept in Maiduguri Barracks guard room. But look at what happened, just overnight these people launched an attack, spent over 2 &#8211; 3hrs and videoed everything without any military response and they went away free.</p>



<p>&#8220;You will catch a Boko Haram in Maiduguri, you will get an order ‘don&#8217;t harm him’, and within 24 hours, the person will disappear. And any soldier that tortures them, they will put you into the guardroom and give him IHL, imprisonment with hard labour. They will tell you it is not your duty, your duty is to capture them and you do not have power to do anything to them.</p>



<p>&#8220;The sad news now is that, upon the loss of soldiers and equipment, thinking government will do everything to bring these terrorists to book and do the needful. The news we heard is that government has set them free and not only that, they are giving them skill acquisition so that they will be able to fit in into the society. They are saying they have repented.</p>



<p>&#8220;Boko Haram who has been terrorising the town, making people homeless, making people lose lives and property. And the government is saying they are being repented. What of the soldiers that ran out of arms that you dismissed? He is now pleading to come back, you said no that they cannot come back again.</p>



<p>&#8220;The news of Kuje prison is not a good one, people are not happy about it at all. The soldiers now prefer to capture and kill them, then wait for the consequences.</p>



<p>&#8220;We now consider them as ‘Government Boys’, the Boko Haram who only understand minor English will tell you, ‘If you want to kill me, you kill me. If not, when I go, they will leave me’, which is the truth.”</p>



<p>&#8220;So, the war is meant for the Generals to enjoy, not for the least of soldiers. You don&#8217;t have mind to talk, and when you do, you are in trouble. Even though you leave this country, they will still track you, except you will not use handset. Even our allowance,s they keep slashing from it, including station allowances,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>The Jamā’at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da’wah wa’l-Jihād faction of the Boko Haram fighters has appointed Ameer Hassan as its new “governor of the Mandara Hills” in Borno State.<br />A counterinsurgency expert, Zagazola Makama, disclosed this in a series of tweets on Tuesday.</p>



<p>The new governor, Hassan was said to have replaced Ummate Ma also known as Muhamma after he was eliminated along with some of his fighters in a rival clash with the Islamic State of the West African Province (ISWAP), in June 2022.<br />The appointment was announced by the Boko Haram Ameerul Fiyah Mallam Ali Ngulde, the overall leader of the terror group leading the Mandara Hills in the Gwoza Local Government Area of Borno State, Makama said.<br />Ngulde is one of the notorious terror leaders of the Boko Haram and has been on the most wanted list of the Nigerian military for the past six years.</p>



<p>“In April 13, 2022, Ngulde was rumoured to have been killed when troops of the Special Forces of Operation Hadin Kai dismantled his stronghold killing some of his fighters and forcing many other Jihadists to surrender to the Nigerian troops.</p>



<p>Findings from some of the surrendered insurgents revealed that Ndulde was still alive noting that during the deadly encounter with troops, he escaped through the axis of Cinana Gwoshe, Barawa and Agaba before crossing over to Cameroon axis where he is currently hiding.<br />“The new appointment and leadership of Amir Hassan was expected to trigger a wave of planned and directed attacks against soft civilian and military positions especially in the route between Banki to Gwoza town,” Makama said.</p>
