<p>Popular Nigerian skit maker and singer, Oderhwo Joseph Efe, also known as Carter Efe, has disclosed that he used to be a tailor before becoming famous.</p>



<p>The ‘Machala’ singer claimed that comedy, to him, was inborn</p>



<p>He stated that he has always enjoyed art, which led him to learn tailoring at some point.</p>



<p>Featuring recently on Hip TV programme, Trending, hosted by reality star, KimOprah, Carter Efe said, “I have been funny right from birth. I’ve been doing stand-up comedy since I was in school. During break time, I would just stand in front of the class and start making people laugh.</p>



<p>“I was a tailor before I ventured into skit making. I love art. For example, I edit my skits by myself. I told my dad one day that I wanted to learn tailoring. He said what of my education and I insisted that I want to learn tailoring because I love creativity. I didn’t even spend up to six months before learning how to sew.</p>



<p>“When I was learning tailoring, sometimes I would lie to my boss that I was sick and go to shoot a skit. Then I will come back in the afternoon. He still punished me. He would tell me to kneel. I would kneel till the end of the day.</p>



<p>“Until one day, Broda Shaggi posted a challenge on Instagram: he said everybody should vibe to a song. Back then I was in Delta State. I said let me just vibe to it and I vibed to the song then I came out first. I won PS5.</p>



<p>“Shaggi said I should come to Lagos to receive my prize. When I collected the PS5, I sold it for about N300,000. Then I decided to stay back in Lagos. I was using the N300,000 for transport fares to go to locations to shoot my skit. I was staying with one of my friends then.”</p>
