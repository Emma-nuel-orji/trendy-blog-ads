<p>Legendary Canadian singer Celine Dion no longer has ‘control over her muscles,’ according to her older sister Claudette.</p>



<p>This is coming a year after the ‘My Heart Will Go On’ hitmaker was forced to cancel her world tour. According to Daily Mail, her sibling, Claudette, suggested that it may be awhile before Celine, 55, returns to the stage following her battle with a neurological disorder called stiff-person syndrome.</p>



<p>Celine’s condition, which is progressive and incurable, causes the body to att@ck its own nerve cells and severely impacts mobility. “She’s working hard, but she doesn’t have control over her muscles. What breaks my heart is that she’s always been disciplined,’ Claudette told 7 Jours.</p>



<p>“She’s always worked hard. Our mother always told her, ‘You’re going to do it well, you’re going to do it properly.’ She continued: ‘It’s true that in both our dreams and hers, the goal is to return to the stage. In what capacity? I don’t know.’</p>



<p>While research is ongoing into the condition, the rarity of it means progress has been slow. Claudette added: ‘The vocal cords are muscles, and the heart is also a muscle. This is what comes to get me. Because it’s 1 out of a million case, the scientists haven’t done that much research because it didn’t affect that many people.’</p>



<p>It would be recalled that months ago, Claudette revealed that despite working with ‘the top researchers in the field’, her sister has seen little improvement in her health.</p>



<p>She told Le Journal de Montreal: ‘We can’t find any medicine that works, but having hope is important.’</p>
