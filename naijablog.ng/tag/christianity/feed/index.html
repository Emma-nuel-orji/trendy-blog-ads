<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s an offence to the Lord, it&#8217;s an offence to say give $1,000. I think it&#8217;s an offence to the Holy Spirit to place a price on the Gospel.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m done with it. I will never again ask you to give $1,000 or whatever amount, because I think the Holy Ghost is just fed up with it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What was troubling is the mentioning of amounts connected to some blessing that should come back just because you gave.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It just got out of hand; give a thousand to get whatever, a hundredfold. I, myself, said [those things] and my heart was saying different.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What if that hundredfold never came back? What does that do to their faith? What does it do to his future and her future? And then, if it doesn&#8217;t come, that life is damaged,&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had people come to me and say, &#8216;please, don&#8217;t say it again, it&#8217;s not working in my life.&#8221;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sometimes you dismiss it, other times you just don&#8217;t know what to say or do. But, it has damaged a lot of people.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How long do I have on this earth? What am I going to do in the next twenty years? That is for me to decide.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to make sure that the next 15-20 years of my life, that my message is the cross. The real call on my life.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to be known for that. I don&#8217;t want to be known as the prosperity teacher.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Prosperity is one thing in the Bible, there&#8217;s a whole lot more in the Word of God than prosperity but it&#8217;s become a major issue now because of the gimmickry involved in it. That needs to stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two sons of Rev. Daniel Umaru of EYN Church, who were murdered by kidnappers in Adamawa State have been laid to rest.</p>



<p>Recall that gunmen invaded the cleric&#8217;s home in Mubi Local Government Area of the state, killed his sons, Kefrey Daniel,19, and Fanye Daniel (Junior) 23, and kidnapped his 13-year-old daughter, Ijagla.</p>



<p>The victims were buried on Friday, July 8, at EYN Headquarters in Kwarhi Maararba, Hong Local Government Area of the state.</p>



<p>According to a video shared by a staff of Adamawa State University Mubi, Hyello John, the victims&#8217; mother, Rev. (Mrs) Daniel Umoro, said she has forgiven her sons’ killers. “I have forgiven those behind this killings and abduction. Also, I have accepted the will of God,” she said.</p>

<p>Ahead of the 2023 general elections, Bishop David Abioye, Vice President of Living Faith Church Worldwide, has called on Christians to vote for candidates of their faith.</p>



<p>The resident pastor of Goshen City, Abuja, who made the call during a sermon, alleged that Christians are been marginalized in the country.</p>



<p>According to him, most of the attacks carried out by the bloodthirsty bandits are targeted against the Christians, asking members to vote candidates who would defend the Christians.</p>



<p>He said, “Who are the people to vote for? First of all, vote for competence, vote for delivery. Who is it that can competently lead this nation? Who are the ones that can bring us out of the mess, killings, corruption? Find out but get your card ready.</p>



<p>We vote for competence and we vote for the defence of the faith. You know how much the church has suffered in the last eight years. Killings in Plateau, Taraba, Benue and largely in Christian communities.</p>



<p>“Vote for only people who can defend our faith. Vote for individuals who cares for other ethnic groups and not focusing on only Fulanis.</p>



<p>“All the ones that have been killing people, have you heard that anyone was arrested? No! you won’t hear that. How many of the officials went to Owo where the bandits killed people?</p>



<p>“If anybody tells you now that there is no religion in politics, they are deceiving you. Don’t hide it, vote for your faith. Till tomorrow, I will vote for my faith. I won’t vote someone who will slaughter me.</p>



<p>“Look at Nasarawa for instance, largely populated by Christiana but how many Commissioner do you have? Why do you think that a Christian should not be a governor in that state?</p>



<p>“Why do they think they cannot have Christian-Muslim ticket in a party? I don’t belong to any political party but I have political sense. I hope the christians in such parties will come to their senses.</p>

<p>A Nigeria Pastor who used the photos of Akwa Tiwara Aki, the popular native doctor in Oba in his live video has vowed never to apologise.</p>



<p>Akwa Tiwara Aki gave him 4 days to apologise for defaming him online. &#8221; I don&#8217;t know this Pastor, why did he use my photos to talk bad about me just to get views, I am giving him four days to officially apologize, if not, he will hear from my gods. I have 298 spirits working for me, I am not ordinary dibia, he first looked for my trouble, I will deal with him.</p>



<p>I have lots of pastors i do prepare juju for them to get members, why is this one defaming me instead of coming and I work for him&#8221; Akwa said in a live video.</p>



<p>Reacting to the threats, he vowed never to apologise.</p>



<ul><li>In an interview granted to Prophet Ezeugo today, he stood his ground to say that he will never apologise to any Native doctor.</li><li>Self acclaimed prophet, Ezeugo had also said that he is not throwing a challenge to anybody, but Akwa Okuko can do nothing to him.</li></ul>



<p>He said this in an interview, that the pastor was trying to remind him about the death of Ada Jesus.</p>



<p>After tomorrow, 4th day. We will know if truly there is power.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Written by Mr. Chris Okafor</p>



<p>I had a family friend. Late Fr Cyril Ofoegbu. He was ordained in 1982 or sometime around the early eighties. He was ordained in Archdiocese of Benin city by the most urbane holiness.. the American trained Archibishop Pat Ekpu. Fr Cyril traversed the entire landscape in the archdiocese of Benin. He was a compulsive polyglot.. he could speak Bini, Urobho, kwale, Esan and Auchi! He had this charming personality of integrating into his community of service by learning their languages. Lest I forget, he was from IMO state. While in his apostolate trajectory, he never forgot his books because he strained and got a doctorate degree in Psychology.</p>



<p>And as Fr Cyril was struggling with his apostolate outside his home town, the structures took notice. He was made the Chancellor of the archdiocese of Benin. I guess, that position put him up as the number one priest in the archdiocese after the bishop. Certainly, he made friends and foes. The foes he made were those who felt that he had no business to be the chancellor of archdiocese of Benin. He was perceived as an invader and as one who wanted to dominate in another’s home. Possibly, his name must have come up for bishopric along the line. And Fr James Anelu was in Benin diocese about this time.</p>



<p>Now to the sad part. Some years back, Fr Cyril was on official assignment from Benin to Asaba. He was being driven by his driver. As they were approaching Asaba, he received a call and he described to the caller where he was. He spoke in English. Few meters along the road, criminals crossed them in, they shot him specifically and pointedly until he died. They took his phone and left. As usual, the police skirted the edges and closed up the case. I don’t know if any suspect was arrested. And Fr James Anelu was serving in Benin then.</p>



<p>Anyway, I am not saying that Fr James Anelu knows who killed Fr Cyril. God forbid a murder in Vatican, but with his blurt and his magisterial banning of Igbo songs in open church, I think he has capacity to do a few bad things. He is filled with hate and he couldn’t hide it. He was good with the offertory being given by his Igbo parishioners but he couldn’t tolerate a worship song in Igbo language. And please, a man filled with hate can do worse things to satisfy his hate. So Fr Cyril could have been murdered because of hate and fear of domination.. even when Fr James Anelu, the hater and scaremonger for domination was in the same diocese with him..</p>

<p>The Parish Priest of Holy Trinity Catholic Church, Ewu-Owa Gberigbe in Ikorodu, Lagos, Rev. Fr. James Anelu, has been “suspended” for banning Igbo songs and choruses in his parish.</p>



<p>The Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos, Alfred Martins, in a “disclaimer”, directed the priest to proceed on “an indefinite leave of absence”.</p>



<p>Anelu was reported to have banned Igbo songs and choruses in his parish, arguing that the excesses of Ndigbo must be contained.</p>



<p>Native Reporters learnt that he had angrily stopped a soul-lifting chorus during the second collection, noting that Igbos cannot keep dominating other people in his Catholic parish.</p>



<p>He reportedly cited the case of his Benin Diocese where Igbos dominate to the point of becoming the Bishop, allegedly claiming that the spirit of God recognises only geographical languages of the parish.</p>

<p>The Senior pastor of Divine Mercy Church, Olatobiloba Peters has unveiled some revelations which he claimed God gave him about the late Nigerian televangelist, Temitope Balogun, also known as TB Joshua and Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB.</p>



<p>Pastor Peters disclosed that God revealed to him that TB Joshua was not in heaven.</p>



<p>Speaking with DAILY POST, the clergyman stated that the powers of the founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, SCOAN, was not from God.</p>



<p>TB Joshua had died a few days ago after conducting a service in his church.</p>



<p>He was found unconscious in his private apartment while the service was ongoing in Lagos.</p>



<p>This is coming at a time the Senior Pastor of Christian Life Church, Jackson Senyonga had described TB Joshua as the “biggest witch in Africa.”</p>



<p>On his part, Pastor Peters said: “God showed me in a revelation of the night that Temitope Joshua did not make it to heaven. In that revelation, I saw that he could not make it because the powers he was using was not from God, this is what was revealed to me.</p>



<p>“TB Joshua was, however, a good man and one of the greatest philanthropists of our time but the things of the spirit are different from how many see things.</p>



<p>“It’s not about being a philanthropist, but is God really involved? Is God happy with what he was doing? God is not his source of power and this should be a lesson to humanity.”</p>



<p>The pastor also disclosed that Nnamdi Kanu may not see the end of the year.</p>



<p>“I see Nnamdi Kanu vacating this earth and another taking his place as a result of his demise.</p>



<p>“Mark my word, Kanu will not be the one to actualize Biafra; we will not live long to see it happen.</p>



<p>“Tell Kanu to amend and make his ways right with God because I see him exiting this earth soon,” he said.</p>

<ul><li>By Pastor (Mrs) Faith Oyedepo</li></ul>



<p>Proverbs 18:22 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.</p>



<p>The question of who should initiate courtship has become a huge one especially among matured singles even in Christendom today.</p>



<p>To INITIATE means to cause a process or action to begin and COURTSHIP is the period between when two people of opposite sex who are fully convinced, agree to get married to each other and when they actually get married.</p>



<p>Biblically and from time in history, the process of courtship begins when a man or his family approaches the woman he decides to be married to with the intent of marriage and consent is given. Even in some cultures where matchmaking is practiced, the intending groom still has to visit the proposed bride&#8217;s family and consent or agreement must be reached before courtship can begin.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s do a little bit of Bible research right here and today, we are going to be doing a bit of reading of several verses of Scripture. The Bible uses the term such as find, give, take etc., to describe the man getting a wife. For instance, in Proverbs 18:22, it says &#8220;whoso FINDETH a wife…&#8221;, Proverbs 31:10 says, &#8220;who can FIND a virtuous woman?…&#8221; What can we deduce from these two scriptures? Very clear, the man is to FIND and the woman is to BE FOUND. Clear! Simple!</p>



<p>1 Corinthians 7:38 So then he that GIVETH her in marriage doeth well….</p>



<p>What do we deduce from the above scripture?<br />The woman is GIVEN in marriage</p>



<p>See, even normal wedding proceedings also validate this fact when it is asked &#8220;who GIVETH this woman in marriage?&#8221;</p>



<p>There are also several instances in the Bible where the man is said to TAKE a wife.<br />(Genesis 24:4) &#8211; Abraham sent his servant to take a wife for his son Isaac<br />(Judges 12:9) &#8211; Ibzan of Bethelehem TOOK thirty daughters in for his thirty sons<br />(Hosea 1:2) &#8211; God told Hosea to TAKE a wife</p>



<p>Now, let us take a look at some other instances in the Bible:</p>



<ul><li>Adam spoke out the first words to Eve and not the other way round<br />Genesis 2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</li><li>Jacob approached Laban with a proposal to marry Rachael and even waited fourteen years for this request to be fulfilled.</li></ul>



<p>Genesis 29:18 (KJV) And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.</p>



<p>The man is therefore supposed to initiate courtship by making clear marriage intentions while the woman responds. Let me state clearly here that parents can also be instrumental to finding a wife for their son or husband for their daughter. Recommendations or suggestions may also come through trusted third party. Even in all these, the man is still supposed to take responsibility in the marriage process. Isaac, in the Bible, took responsibility over Rebekah even though Abraham his father was instrumental in finding him a wife.</p>



<p>Genesis 24:67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah&#8217;s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her…</p>



<p>How about BOAZ?<br />He took responsibility in ensuring the marriage rites between himself and Ruth was formalized.</p>



<p>Ruth 4:13 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife…</p>



<p>Clearly, from the above Biblical references, God designed that the man takes the leadership role especially in marital responsibility. It is the man&#8217;s God-given role to INITIATE while it is the woman&#8217;s God-given role to RESPOND.</p>



<p>Single men, listen very carefully, you must learn how to LEAD!<br />Single ladies, listen to me very carefully, you need to learn what it takes for a man to assume spiritual responsibility in a romantic relationship. This is very crucial!</p>



<p>The question then is, so, IS IT WRONG FOR A WOMAN TO INITIATE COURTSHIP? Especially in today&#8217;s world where women have evolved into strong and independent figures?</p>



<p>My answer: Maybe not. In actual fact, some situations might even warrant it.</p>



<p>BUT…</p>



<p>If a woman proposes to a man and initiates courtship, there are three possibilities:</p>



<p>1) The man may feel he is being pressured and quickly backs up and before you know it, he rejects the proposal and then the woman faces the consequences.</p>



<p>2) The man may accept the proposal, however, because the woman took the initiative, he may be happy to let her take the lead in that relationship and of course later in marriage, she may end up regretting why her husband does not take the initiative or demonstrate leadership in the home.</p>



<p>Again, she has to face the reality of the consequences.</p>



<p>3) The man may appreciate and accept the initiation from the woman of the courtship, he may immediately or over time, take up the leadership role in the relationship and everything may eventually work out fine.</p>



<p>However, research also shows that somehow, most men discover their manhood as they rise to meet challenges of life. When a woman initiates courtship, the man has no challenge to overcome and women on the other hand, are generally more relational than men are. You must be open to and discern God&#8217;s plan for your life.</p>



<p>A man who fails to take responsibility in courtship may also likely fail to take leadership in marriage while a woman who initiates courtship may eventually undermine the headship of her husband.</p>



<p>LADIES! Listen to me very well, even when you are convinced of a particular person as it relates to marriage, it is wisdom to allow him to also be convinced. Marriage, you must understand, is not by force, it is by agreement. It is not wisdom to force a romantic relationship, so you don&#8217;t end up regretting.</p>



<p>I pray for you today that your relationship and marital destiny will not end up in regret in Jesus name!</p>



<p>My Personal Example:<br />Before my husband approached me with the intent of marriage, God had already revealed that to me! However, I didn&#8217;t tell anyone, neither did I tell him. I waited for him to make his intentions known. And when he did, I made sure that I waited for the right time before a response was given. Today, almost forty years after, my testimony, to the glory of God, is that I married someone who makes me fall in love with God every single day of my life. I can&#8217;t be more grateful to God than that.</p>



<p>My sincere advice is that, before you initiate courtship, think deeply! Please, matured men and women, LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP! Especially you ladies. Remember, just because society is confused about the role of man and woman does not mean that Christians should be. You must understand that courtship is a commitment with a promise not to play games with another person&#8217;s heart. Don&#8217;t rush to accept a proposal, spend some time to think, to pray and to seek godly counsel before giving your response if need be.</p>



<p>In conclusion, as you lay your bed, so you would lie on it. Therefore, I pray for you today, especially those of you who are not into any relationship yet, that the wisdom of God that guided my steps will be available to you and that your own testimony shall be stronger in Jesus name!</p>



<p>As you take steps towards initiating courtship, I pray that your steps shall not falter and you will enjoy a glorious marriage!</p>

<p>The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God has enjoined members and mourners not to weep for his deceased son, Dare.</p>



<p>He said this in his short exhortation during the farewell service for Dare on Tuesday.</p>



<p>In the video which was shared on his verified Instagram page, Pastor Adeboye described his son&#8217;s death as a seed that will bring &#8220;special harvest.&#8221;</p>



<p>He said, &#8220;Cry if you wish to but not for Pastor Dee because he&#8217;s resting in glory.&#8221;</p>



<p>He went on to ask for prayers while expressing his gratitude for the support his family has received so far.</p>



<p>Adeboye said, &#8220;Pray for me. Keep on praying for us, pray for my wife, keep on praying for the widow, for the children but more than anything else, keep on praying for yourself, so that you too will finish well and finish strong.&#8221;</p>
