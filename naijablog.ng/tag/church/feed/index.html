<p>The Senior Pastor of Household of David Church, Lagos, Olusola Osunmakinde, has reacted to the Wednesday fire that burnt down the entire church auditorium, saying &#8220;It is a painful experience.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to Osunmakinde, someone who walked into the church premises mocked him by asking, &#8220;Where was Jesus when this happened?&#8221;</p>



<p>The pastor spoke in a video shared on the church’s Instagram account a few hours after the incident occurred.</p>



<p>The Household of David Church which is located on Surulere Road, Ikeja Local Government Area of Lagos State reportedly caught fire, and property worth millions of naira were destroyed.</p>



<p>The Lagos State Fire Service spokesperson, Amodu Shakiri, disclosed to our correspondent that the church’s auditorium ceiling was overheating, which caused the ceiling to collapse and ignite a fire.</p>



<p>The church programme tagged, &#8216;Mercy Conference&#8217;, was to start today, January 31, 2024 before the church was engulfed by fire.</p>



<p>Osunmakinde stated that the church air conditioners, chairs, and other equipment were all burnt.</p>



<p>He said, “As we know, &#8216;Mercy Conference&#8217; starts today, but something happened that I just want to put a message out there to people.</p>



<p>&#8220;I came here this morning, everybody was setting up, everything was going fine. All of a sudden, we started hearing that there was fire and something up there on the roof of the church.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know there would be reactions, and people will say that and that, but that is none of my concern now. The most important thing is this, we thank God no life was lost and we thank God for everything.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are not too discouraged but we believe in God that we will still go on with the conference.</p>



<p>&#8220;To everyone out there, we are not sad, we are happy for all things work together, the Bible didn&#8217;t say all good things, all things both bad and ugly.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is a painful experience no doubt, even someone walked into the compound mocking, saying &#8216;where is Jesus when this happened?&#8217; We don&#8217;t owe people an answer, all we believe is that all things work together.</p>



<p>&#8220;We will know what to do about the building and every prayer, every contribution, every word is necessary now. Today&#8217;s meeting goes on this evening if we have to lift our hands and worship outside we will do it.</p>



<p>&#8220;We will not back out because of this but by the grace of God, all things work together for good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Did you know that Islam has never urge Muslim to destroy Churches and synagogue?.</p>



<p>Yes, contrary to the believe by many non-muslim, that Islam is religion or war.</p>



<p>And some radical Muslim who go about causing trouble, here come verse of the Holy Qur&#8217;an in chapter 22 urge everyone include Muslim to Protect Church, synagogue and Mosques.</p>



<p>The verse of the Qur&#8217;an in Arabic read:</p>



<p>{ ٱلَّذِينَ أُخۡرِجُواْ مِن دِيَٰرِهِم بِغَيۡرِ حَقٍّ إِلَّآ أَن يَقُولُواْ رَبُّنَا ٱللَّهُۗ وَلَوۡلَا دَفۡعُ ٱللَّهِ ٱلنَّاسَ بَعۡضَهُم بِبَعۡضٖ لَّهُدِّمَتۡ صَوَٰمِعُ وَبِيَعٞ وَصَلَوَٰتٞ وَمَسَٰجِدُ يُذۡكَرُ فِيهَا ٱسۡمُ ٱللَّهِ كَثِيرٗاۗ وَلَيَنصُرَنَّ ٱللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُۥٓۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَقَوِيٌّ عَزِيزٌ }<br />[Surah Al-Ḥajj: 40]</p>



<p>Here come the first translation by Sheikh Mufti Taqi Usmani.</p>



<p>Mufti Taqi Usmani:<br />(They are) the ones who were expelled from their homes without any just reason, except that they say “Our Lord is Allah.” Had Allah not been repelling some people by means of some others, the monasteries, the churches, the synagogues and the mosques where Allah’s name is abundantly recited would have been demolished. Allah will definitely help those who help Him (by defending the religion prescribed by Him.) Surely Allah is Powerful, Mighty.</p>



<p>Incase you want read in Arabic and you don&#8217;t understand Arabic, here is the English.</p>



<p>The  English Transliteration:</p>



<p><br />Allatheena okhrijoo min diyarihimbighayri haqqin illa an yaqooloo rabbuna Allahuwalawla dafAAu Allahi annasa baAAdahumbibaAAdin lahuddimat sawamiAAu wabiyaAAun wasalawatunwamasajidu yuthkaru feeha ismu Allahikatheeran walayansuranna Allahu man yansuruhuinna Allaha laqawiyyun AAazeez</p>



<p>Another translation by Dr. Mustafa Khattab read:</p>



<p>Dr. Mustafa Khattab:<br />˹They are˺ those who have been expelled from their homes for no reason other than proclaiming: “Our Lord is Allah.” Had Allah not repelled ˹the aggression of˺ some people by means of others, destruction would have surely claimed monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which Allah’s Name is often mentioned. Allah will certainly help those who stand up for Him. Allah is truly All-Powerful, Almighty.</p>



<p>This from Qur&#8217;an, happy Friday to our Muslim brother and sister.</p>



<p>Let love lead&#8230;. </p>

<p>A UK High Court has ordered the closure of the Salvation Proclaimer Ministries Limited, popularly known as SPAC Nation, run by Nigerian-born Tobi Adegboyega, in public interest.</p>



<p>In a statement on the UK government’s website on Friday, the court presided over by Juge Burton gave the order on June 9, 2022, with the Official Receiver appointed as liquidator.</p>



<p>The London-based church group was wound up after failing to properly account for more than £1.87 million of outgoings and operating with a lack of transparency.</p>



<p>The court heard that SPAC Nation was incorporated in 2012, as a charity set up to advance Christianity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Rev Canon LumenCristi Eboh, a priest of the Anglican communion in Anambra State, has resigned as an ordained priest of the church.</p>



<p>Speaking at a press briefing in Awka, on Monday, March 7, the cleric accused some forces in the church of separating him from his wife, and quartered her at an undisclosed place.</p>



<p>He specifically accused his diocesan, Bishop Owen Nwokolo, of w!tch-hunt and land grabbing, and an attempt to arm-twist him into making him a member of the board of a ministry he founded privately.</p>



<p>Eboh who owns a charismatic congregation and prayer ministry known as God in Action Adoration Ministry cited har#ssment, instigation and conspiracy by the diocesan authorities of the Anglican Diocese as reasons for his resignation.</p>



<p>According to him, “As I speak, my wife is living differently in an apartment paid for by someone who knows that she is someone’s wife. I am only a priest permitted by my communion to enter the sacred institution of marriage.</p>



<p>As a married man, I had very private moments with my wife and we shared endearing words just like every young couple. With the cr#sh of my marriage, I have sought to reorder my life, but those fi#hting me have even sent young women here in an attempt to use prospects of marriage to malign my character and reputation.”</p>



<p>Eboh, a radio and televangelist, noted that his involvement in charismatic activities was at the centre of his confl!ct with the Bishop, who he accused of high handedness, inti#idation and conspiratorial mani#ulations, leading to his decision to resign.</p>



<p>He also accused the bishop of insisting that the registered trustees of the adoration ministry be altered to include the bishop and his wife, a condition he resisted on the basis that God did not reveal the bishop to him as a vessel in the ministry.</p>



<p>He alleged that his refusal to include the Bishop as trustee as demanded and to hand over landed property of the adoration ministry to him set him on a collision course with the bishop.</p>

<p>Church Gist reports that a Living Faith Church Pastor, Pastor Chris A who was recently transferred from Abuja to another state in Nigeria has been gifted a brand new car.</p>



<p>The Farewell gift was from an appreciative member popularly known as Major Mega.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fb_img_1630340550631975494577121551094-473x630.jpg?resize=473%2C630&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-94615" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>The vehicle, a land cruiser is the latest of its series. Church Gist gathered that the price of 2022 Toyota Land Cruiser in Nigeria including landing cost is from N55 million (55,000,000) Naira or $110,000.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fb_img_16303405720115407573519509455352.jpg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-94616" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>The Living Faith Church discourages Pastors from placing financial burdens on members and frowns at levies of any kind on its members. This is the reason why she doesn’t collect offerings in naming or wedding ceremonies or even her daily Covenant Hour of Prayer services. She is one of the churches that discourages members from standing up to drop/throw money on the Altar during services or while a message is ongoing and collects offerings only once in every regular service except the monthly thanksgiving service and annual sacrifices.<br />This could be the reason members are usually appreciative of their branch pastors as is the case here.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fb_img_16303405794556220110278449313086.jpg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-94614" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>Truly, a laborer is worthy of his wages.<br />Congratulations to Pastor Chris A.</p>

<p>1 Timothy 5:18<br />For the Scripture says, “You must not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating as it treads out the grain.”<br />And in another place, “Those who work deserve their pay!”</p>



<p>There is an evil I see in ministry today where a Pastor with wife and kids is paid peanuts but the day he decides to leave the ministry to go and look for a secured future for his family, the ministry he left will spend millions to go and host programs in that city in order to retain the members of the congregation he left from.<br />Those crusades organized to crucify a once loyal son costs millions yet you were paying the Pastor peanuts. Even the new Pastor you are introducing to the Church as a better replacement shares the same views with the one who left but he can&#8217;t tell you because only few Fathers understand the difference between LOYALTY TO LEADERSHIP and SINCERITY TO LEADERSHIP.<br />You keep saying there is no money to support any branch Church, but the day a branch Pastor leaves, you suddenly have all the millions to fight him.<br />Repent sir, there is a difference between MAFIARISM and EVANGELISM.<br />Some of us are MAFIAS not MINISTERS.</p>



<p>PAY THEM WELL and they will PERFORM WELL.</p>



<p>How can you pay a full time Pastor 50,000 to manage a church with a monthly income of over 5 million?<br />IT WON&#8217;T WORK. You now send an accountant with a salary of 30,000 to monitor him.<br />This is how we unknowingly make Pastors and Accountants become partners in crime.<br />They will both form an evil Partnership against the Ministry.<br />No Ministry can survive that evil combination.<br />A Pastor with an Accountant not well paid yet they see millions weekly through the branch they manage will only produce Robbers in the house of God.<br />No matter the Policies you put in place to Police a Police Man, he will still find a way to collect from the system.<br />POVERTY HAS MADE MOST ASSISTANT PASTORS FUNCTION AS &#8216;POLICE OFFICERS&#8217;.<br />Hear me very well:<br />TO INCREASE WELFARE IS TO REDUCE WARFARE,<br />TO INCREASE REMUNERATION IS TO REDUCE RESIGNATION,<br />TO INCREASE PASTORS&#8217; BREAKTHROUGH IS TO REDUCE PASTOR&#8217;S BREAKAWAY,<br />TO IMPROVE THEIR WELL BEING IS TO SEE THEM BEHAVE AS HUMAN BEINGS,<br />TO SECURE THEIR FUTURE WILL MAKE THEM CONTINUE TO FEATURE IN YOUR FUTURE AND FEATURE IN YOUR FIXTURES.</p>



<p>SOMETIMES THE APPEARANCE OF MORE MONEY TO A STAFF IS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MURMURING FROM THE STAFF.</p>



<p>Be interested in their well-being and they will in turn be interested in the well-being of the system.<br />If a Church is operating a medical centre, let the pastor and his immediate family be placed on a medical rebate.<br />If the ministry is blessed to have their own school, let the Pastor&#8217;s kids be on full scholarship. Never forget the wisdom of Dr Mike Murdock, give a man what he can&#8217;t find anywhere and you won&#8217;t find him anywhere. He will always be with you. A wise man also said &#8216;if you pay peanuts, all you will have as staff are monkeys.<br />Hope you know the work of monkeys? &#8220;They must look for BANANA TO EAT&#8221;</p>



<p>Dear Founder, It is possible.<br />Just have the number of staff you can take care of.<br />&#8220;THE FEWER THE SWEETER&#8221;<br />What is a Church that can&#8217;t pay full time Pastors very well be doing with an Accountant?<br />Pay your full time Pastors very well and you won&#8217;t need an Accountant.<br />And if you know you are not capable of keeping a full time Pastor, don&#8217;t employ one. Because all your Problem will come from those groups of people.<br />Some full time Pastors are full time Parasites. They give nothing to the system but take everything from the system.<br />Another word for full time Pastor is full time responsibility. So check your capacity to manage their responsibilities.<br />Any Church that is not experiencing so many EXITS have a strong WELFARE Package for Pastors.<br />Forget all those visions they come to tell you God showed them, they are all lies.<br />WHEN A MAN DOESN&#8217;T SEE A TOMMOROW WITH YOU, YOU WONT SEE HIM TOMORROW WITH YOU.<br />It is as simple as that.</p>



<p>When Peter asked Jesus having left all to follow you what shall be our gain, Jesus did not curse him, He did not suspend him, He was not sacked by Jesus, Instead Jesus shared with him God&#8217;s Reward system, there is no man that left everything to follow me that will not reap it in THIS WORLD (FIRST) and in the World to come Eternal.<br />Mark 10:29-30.</p>



<p>The Wisdom of Solomon in the book of Proverbs 30 verse 8-9 should be our guide.<br />Excess Wealth may cause us to misbehave and forget God and excess poverty may also cause us to steal and bring shame to God&#8217;s name.<br />So make people comfortable to the extent that they won&#8217;t miss their relationship with the Comforter.<br />The Disciple who betrayed Jesus was the treasurer of the ministry.<br />Prosperity may make them betray God, but poverty will definitely make them betray you. The choice is yours. To betray God, is to use money to do what God did not send them. To betray you is to go and look for a life elsewhere.</p>



<p>Having charged Founders and Fathers on the need to look into the welfare of their Assistant Pastors, let us not forget, it is better to be MADE THAN TO BE PAID.<br />The Word of Christ is FOLLOW me and I will MAKE you, not and I will PAY you.<br />Assistant Pastors, please focus on Mantles not on Money.<br />For with the Mantles, you will command the Money at the right time.<br />My first salary as a Full-time Pastor in the year 1997 was 3000 naira. Yet I was serving faithfully and God was blessing me heavily. It is not the amount you are paid but the blessings of God upon your life.</p>



<p>PLEASE TAKE NOTE:<br />CHURCH FOUNDERS WITH ASSISTANT PASTORS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 40-50 YEARS MUST TAKE THESE SEMINAR NOTES VERY SERIOUS, BECAUSE IT IS AT THIS AGE BRACKET WE HAVE THE HIGHEST NUMBERS OF RESIGNATIONS.<br />At this stage, the only thing that moves them is a SECURED FUTURE.</p>
