<p>A popular Asian-American comedian and activist, Tou Ger Xiong, has been kidnapped and killed while on vacation in Colombia.</p>



<p>He was found dead on Monday, December 11, in Medellin after he went to meet a woman he’d been chatting with online, according to Colombian authorities.</p>



<p>The 50-year-old refugee from Laos based in Minnesota who billed himself as America’s “first Hmong comedian,” arrived in Medellin for a vacation on November 29.</p>



<p>Eh Xiong, his brother, told local news station KSTP-TV that he last heard from his brother on Sunday evening when he asked for $2,000, which he sent. Tou Ger Xiong never confirmed receiving the money.</p>



<p>Eh Xiong also said that when he didn’t receive a response after a couple hours, he called Tou Ger Xiong’s roommate, who told him that he also received a phone call from him, saying that he was being “held at gunpoint.”</p>



<p>Tou Ger Xiong’s body was discovered the next day beside a ravine in a woody area of the Robledo neighborhood of Medellin with more than a dozen stab wounds, authorities said.</p>



<p>Colombian investigator Yiri Milena Amado told local media in a press conference that Tou Ger Xiong went to meet the woman on Sunday and at 7 p.m. he contacted someone in the United States asking for $2,000. Authorities said they believed he may have been killed after he tried to escape.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;I take the blame for the failure because it shouldn&#8217;t have happened. I was stupid, plain and simple,&#8221;</em>&nbsp;she said.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;You know I am a romantic. Love is not enough. A counsellor said to us it is better to have a broken engagement than to have a broken marriage. Automatically I said we have given out IVs. How are we going to do that?&#8221;</em></p>
