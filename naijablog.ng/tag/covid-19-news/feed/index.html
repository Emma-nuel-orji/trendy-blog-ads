<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-71677" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/School-.jpg?resize=474%2C287&#038;ssl=1" alt="School reopening : UN urges Nigeria to adhere to COVID-19 safety precautions" width="474" height="287" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In line with school reopening in Nigeria, the United Nations has called on state authorities in the country to ensure that safety protocols against the spread of COVID-19 are in place before the full reopening of schools.</p>
<p>The agency said that about 46 million primary and secondary learners across Nigeria are affected due to pandemic-related school closures.</p>
<p>Edward Kallon, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, made this known in a statement in commemoration of the World International Day to Protect Education from Attack.</p>
<p>The theme for the Day this year is: “Protect Education, Save a Generation.”</p>
<p>Mr Kallon said that prioritising safety in schools for educators and learners would be an indication of the government’s commitment to protecting investments in the education sector and a validation of Nigeria’s endorsement of the Safe Schools Declaration.</p>
<p>He said,</p>
<p>“As State Governments plan to reopen schools after prolonged closures, building a resilient education system to withstand future shocks should be included in pandemic response plans.</p>
<p>Education is essential to helping crisis-affected communities in the north-east rebuild and recover. Attacks on schools are a direct attack on future generations.</p>
<p>I call on all parties to the conflict to take all necessary measures to protect education and give learners a chance to build a brighter future.&#8221;</p>

<p>Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has said that the Coronavirus pandemic has shown Nigerians that there is need for prayers.⁣<br />
⁣<br />
He said this at the opening ceremony of the 2nd Session of the 34th Synod of the Diocese of Lagos, while urging everyone to continue to pray for the state and country.⁣</p>
<p>He said,<br />
⁣<br />
“COVID-19 has shown us in reality that we need to pray. We are not out of it yet, we need to continue to take precautions. Your prayers has really held us all together.⁣<br />
⁣<br />
The church has also participated in series of activities during the lockdown, various donations have been given to the citizens and I thank all churches for these”.⁣<br />
⁣<br />
Speaking further, the governor said that the numbers were gradually going down in the state.</p>
<p>He also sympathised with everyone that had lost someone during the pandemic.⁣<br />
⁣<br />
“This is a painful thing and as a government we will continue to do what we need to do to keep life alive.&#8221;⁣<br />
⁣<br />
He said that the theme, “Pray, Serve and Grow’, was apt due to the ongoing pandemic ravaging the world.⁣<br />
⁣<br />
“Service to the Lord is serving, loving and supporting one another.For us to build a greatest Lagos, we certainly need to hold on to God and pray.⁣<br />
⁣<br />
We certainly need to use God as an instrument of contact for all of us,” he said.⁣<br />
⁣<br />
He, however, appreciated the frontline health workers who had been working tirelessly during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Dr. Olorunnimbe Mamora, the Minister of State for Health, has said that there is no Russian COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria yet.</p>
<p>The minister said that Alexey Shebarshin, the Russian Ambassador and the Deputy Head of Mission, merely visited the ministry and gave an update on the vaccine.</p>
<p>However, he stated that on arrival, the vaccine would be tested by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, which is lawfully empowered to do so.</p>
<p>He said,</p>
<p>“We have not yet received the vaccine and, to the best of my knowledge, it is not yet ready.</p>
<p>The Russian Ambassador and the Deputy Head of Mission only visited us to give us an update. Many other stakeholders joined the meeting virtually.</p>
<p>When the vaccine is ready and we have received it, it will be subjected to the usual test by NAFDAC and other relevant authorities.”</p>

<p>People are made to lie inside coffins in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, when they violate mask-wearing rules.</p>
<p>While in there, they&#8217;re asked to “contemplate their actions”. It was gathered that those who are caught without a mask in the Kalisari district of the city must count to 100 while on display for passers-by take pictures.</p>
<p>“With Covid-19 there is a risk of them being laid inside a real coffin,&#8221; head of the East Public Order Agency of the capital, Budhy Novian said</p>

<p>Fatality rate of COVID-19 in Nigeria is on the decree in the past five months, according to the Presidential Task Force on Coronavirus.<br />
⁣<br />
The PTF Chairman and Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha said this during the daily briefing of the task force on Monday in Abuja.⁣<br />
⁣<br />
He said,</p>
<p>&#8220;The PTF has however continued to study the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and we note that it has been on steady decline over the last few months.⁣<br />
⁣<br />
On April 30; 3 per cent, May 31; 2.8 per cent, June 30; 2.3 per cent, July 31; 2.0 per cent and Aug. 22; 1.92 per cent.⁣<br />
⁣<br />
We are however convinced that our sample collection is still low. We therefore encourage states to ramp up their testing and to declare correct results because early detection will ultimately translate to treatment and ultimately level the curve.⁣<br />
⁣<br />
With our statistics standing at 52,227 cases and 1,002 fatalities and 38,945 recoveries, Nigeria, however, maintains the 4th highest cumulative cases in Africa.⁣<br />
⁣<br />
Sadly, global cases have increased by another one million from 22.5 million on 19th to the current 23.5 million in about four days.&#8221;</p>

<p>A medical expert has warned about the possibility of coronavirus staying forever.</p>
<p>A member of the Government&#8217;s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), Sir Mark Walport, added that people are likely to need regular vaccinations against the deadly virus.</p>
<p>At BBC Radio 4&#8217;s Today programme, Walport said that the pandemic would be controlled by &#8220;global vaccination&#8221; but it is not &#8220;going to be a disease like smallpox which could be eradicated by vaccination&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said,</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a virus that is going to be with us forever in some form or another and almost certainly will require repeated vaccinations.</p>
<p>So a bit like flu, people will need re-vaccination at regular intervals.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that localised lockdowns are the best way to go at the moment to reduce a spike in the spread of Covid-19.</p>

<p>Wuhan has held a massive pool party which had thousands in attendance.</p>
<p>This is coming three months after there are no reports of new COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>Over the weekend in the Chinese city of Wuhan, thousands of people packed into a water park to attend an electronic music festival.</p>
<p>It can be recalled that the Coronavirus first emerged late last year in the province.</p>
<p>The party took place at Maya Beach Water Park on Saturday, August 15, in the Chinese city of some 11 million residents.</p>
<p>Photos and videos from the crowded pool party show partygoers without face masks as they failed to observe social distancing.</p>
<p>Since the city&#8217;s strict 76-day lockdown was lifted in April, there hasn’t been any new coronavirus cases since May.</p>
