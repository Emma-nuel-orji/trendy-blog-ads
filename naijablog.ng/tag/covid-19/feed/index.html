<p>The Federal Government has announced that travellers coming into Nigeria will no longer be required to take the COVID-19 test as long as they were fully vaccinated before arriving the country.</p>



<p>Boss Mustapha, Chairman of the Presidential Steering Committee, who made the announcement on Monday, March 21, said they would, however, be subjected to rapid antigen test at the airport by the NCDC within the arrival hall of the airport free of charge.</p>



<p>He disclosed that this comes following a revision of the International Travel Protocols by the PSC. Adding that passengers who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated are still expected to pay and take a COVID-19 PCR test 48 hours before departure, or do a Day 2 and day 7 test on arrival.</p>

<p>Nigeria and five other African countries have been selected to begin production of COVID-19 vaccines, with the continent having had limited access to jabs.</p>



<p>In a statement on Friday, WHO said Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa, and Tunisia have been selected as the first recipients of technology from the WHO’s global mRNA vaccine hub.</p>



<p>“Today I’m delighted to announce the first six African countries that will receive technology from the hub to produce their own mRNA vaccines: Egypt, Kenya Nigeria, Senegal South Africa, and Tunisia,” Director-General of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Ghebreyesus, announced on Friday.</p>



<p>According to the WHO, they were selected as the first recipients of technology from the organisation’s global mRNA vaccine hub, in a push to ensure the African continent can make its own jabs to fight COVID and other diseases. “I was honoured to visit the Hub last week. And it’s already producing results, with Afrigen’s announcement that it has produced its own mRNA vaccine, based on publicly-available information about the composition of an existing vaccine,” Ghebreyesus said.</p>



<p>“We expect clinical trials to start in the 4th quarter of this year, with approval expected in 2024. We expect the benefits of this initiative will extend far beyond #COVID19, by creating a platform for vaccines against other diseases including malaria and tuberculosis. WHO will work with the companies and the government in each country to develop a roadmap for training and production, based on their needs and capacities.</p>



<p>“Thank you all, and we look forward to working with all of you to make this project a success, for the healthier, safer and fairer Africa”.</p>

<p>Cannabis compounds prevented the virus that causes Covid-19 from penetrating healthy human cells, according to a laboratory study published in the Journal of Nature Products.</p>



<p>The two compounds commonly found in hemp — called cannabigerolic acid, or CBGA, and cannabidiolic acid, or CBDA — were identified during a chemical screening effort as having potential to combat coronavirus, researchers from Oregon State University said.</p>



<p>In the study, they bound to spike proteins found on the virus and blocked a step the pathogen uses to infect people, Bloomberg reports.</p>



<p>The researchers tested the compounds’ effect against alpha and beta variants of the virus in a laboratory. The study didn’t involve giving the supplements to people or comparing infection rates in those who use the compounds to those who don’t.</p>



<p>According to Richard van Breemen, a researcher with Oregon State’s Global Hemp Innovation Center, “These compounds can be taken orally and have a long history of safe use in humans. They have the potential to prevent as well as treat infection by SARS-CoV-2.”</p>

<p>The man who share his thoughts on twitter, later change his mind after he realizes that his dog will be taken away from him if he tested positive for the virus.</p>



<p>He said </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>I was looking forward to catch omicron, that way I could take at least two weeks covid leave, but then I realized that if I have shown positive then it&#8217;s very likely the government would take my dog away and euthanize him. I cannot let that happen.</p></blockquote>

<p>Less impact of the virus to Africa is still a question of debates among top scientist in the world.</p>

<p>The United States of America, is on the round up for the development of vaccine for new variant of COVID-19, Omicron.</p>



<p>The development was made known in Facebook post by President Joe Biden few minutes ago.</p>



<p>Biden on the post says that the vaccines potency will be made Known to the General public in few weeks from now.</p>



<p>However, he assured U.S citizens that the United States COVID-19 vaccines will continue to provide degree of protection against severe disease.</p>



<p>Joe Biden said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>It will be a few weeks before we know everything we need to know about how strongly the existing vaccines protect against the new variant. But Dr. Fauci and our medical team believe that our vaccines will continue to provide a degree of protection against severe disease.</p></blockquote>
