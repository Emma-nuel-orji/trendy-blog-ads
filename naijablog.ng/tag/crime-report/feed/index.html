<p>Akwa Ibom State High Court sitting in Ikot Ekpene, has sentenced a 31-year-old man, Edidiong Pius Ototi to death, for killing his father, late Mr. Pius David Ototi, whom he accused of being a wizard.</p>



<p>In its judgment, this morning, the Court, presided over by Justice Augustine Odokwo, found Ototi guilty of murder, which is punishable by death, under section 326 (1) of the Criminal Code, Laws of Akwa Ibom State 2000.</p>



<p>Justice Odokwo, who was dressed in black with a sentencing cap, held that Ototi be hanged by the neck until he dies, praying God to have mercy upon his soul.</p>



<p>He said the prosecution team from the State Ministry of Justice has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offense.</p>



<p>Edidiong Ototi, a native of Ikot Akwa in Obot Akara Local Government Area, had admitted in his confessional statement at the Police Headquarters, Ikot Akpan Abia, that he killed his father and buried him inside a pit toilet on 18th November, 2018.</p>



<p>Justice Odokwo, in a one-hour judgment said, Ototi had no right under the law to take the life of his 60-year-old father, whom he accused of being responsible for the untimely death of his two grandchildren.</p>



<p>The accused, had before his sentence, turned to a Pastor in the Courtroom, quoting Bible portions, begging the Judge to forgive him and temper justice with mercy.</p>

<p>Nigerian man who battled depression for 7 years ‚Äòcommits suicide‚Äô</p>



<p>Dele Bandele, a Nigerian man, who was earlier declared missing by friends, has reportedly been found dead.</p>



<p>Friends of Bandele had earlier taken to the social media to ask of his whereabouts using a flyer which contained phone numbers for contact as well as his picture.</p>



<p>The deceased was said to be last seen at Omole Phase 2 axis of Lagos while his last known location was said to be at the Third Mainland Bridge.</p>



<p>Bandele, who is said to be a digital strategist, was found dead on Tuesday ‚Äî a few hours after he was declared missing. It is believed that the deceased committed suicide.</p>



<p>In a now-viral suicide note left behind, Bandele said he had battled with depression for seven years.</p>



<p>The young Nigerian also revealed that he had previously attempted suicide on three occasions but had been discouraged by thoughts of the consequences to those around him, particularly his mother.</p>



<p>He, however, said his seemingly elusive search for ‚Äúpeace and rest‚Äù made him attempt the fourth time, which comes a week after his birthday.</p>



<p>‚ÄúI have battled with depression for 7 years, and now that battle is over. l couldn‚Äôt continue to live the way l did and make the same bad choices again. The noise got too loud but now the noise can stop again‚Äù he had written.</p>



<p>‚ÄúP.s I didn‚Äôt send my mum a note because l couldn‚Äôt bear to. If you‚Äôre reading this, then you probably know how much she meant to me. The thought of her would have discouraged me. l couldn‚Äôt let it. Not for the 4th time.</p>



<p>‚ÄúTake care of her for me. Take care of Folarin for me. To my father, I pray the Father forgives him.</p>



<p>‚ÄúLike l have always said, ‚Äòlife is like a party, when you stop having fun, leave‚Äô. So it had to be today, a week after my birthday. Please pray for my soul. Pray that l finally find peace and rest. It‚Äôs all I ever wanted. I love you dearly. Goodnight.‚Äù</p>



<p>Efforts by TheCable Lifestyle on Wednesday to get Muyiwa Adejobi, Lagos police spokesman, to comment on Bandele‚Äôs death did not materialise as of the time this report was filed.</p>



<p>The phone numbers on the flyer earlier circulated about the deceased‚Äôs whereabouts could also not be reached for reaction.</p>



<p>News of his demise has since sparked reactions on social media, with many Nigerians paying tributes to the young man.</p>



<p>Joining the fray, Davido, a Nigerian singer, wrote: ‚ÄúRIP Dele‚Ä¶sad.‚Äù</p>

<p>Being a Nigerian alone could trigger suicidal thought‚Ä¶ People pass through hell every single day of their life</p>

<p>Majority of Male Children and first borns are depressed. The society expects them to be strong at all times so they bottle up their emotions.</p>

<p>Depression is real, when someone makes a post about quitting, it doesn&#8217;t really mean they intend doing it, they just need words of encouragement to get life going, yet some bluffs who hasn&#8217;t experienced sh*t, doesn&#8217;t know what it entails, so they make jokes outta it.</p>

<p>We all are emotional right now about the demise of Dele. By tomorrow, y&#8217;all go back to trolling &amp; bullying everyone on &amp; offline not minding their mental health all in the name of savagery for few likes &amp; RTs.<br>Many are battling depression. Be kind.</p>



<p>RIP Dele.</p>

<p> The two suspects arrested in Bauchi over ritual killing of a little girl have been telling the police why they embarked on the dastardly act.</p>



<p>A news website, PRNigeria reported that the suspects, in an audio clip of the interrogation confessed that a marabou (native doctor) contracted them to bring the vagina of a little girl for ritual purposes for the sum of N500, 000.</p>



<p>The two suspects, Abdulkadir Wada, 19, and Adamu Abdulrauf, 20, made the confession during their interrogation by officers of the Bauchi State Police Command after they were arrested.</p>



<p>Speaking in Hausa, Wada, the chief culprit, said both he and his accomplice, Abdulrauf, had gone to Kwata, the area where the latter‚Äôs elder brother, who is married, is staying.</p>



<p>Upon reaching the area, they waylaid a little girl into an uncompleted building and strangled her to death.</p>



<p>‚ÄúAbdulrauf then removed a knife from his pocket and cut off the girl‚Äôs private part. It was a marabout, who is now at large, that asked us to get him a female sexual part in return for N500,000,‚Äù he said. On his part, Abdulrauf, denied killing their victim, saying: ‚ÄúIt was Wada who came and met me in our house. He told me that he and one of his friend went to a spiritualist who promised them N500,000 if they bring a female vagina. But I told him I am not interested.</p>



<p>‚ÄúSo, I discussed with one of my friend called Musa who advised me to avoid Wada. The next day, while I was in my shop doing my mechanic work, I met Wada at the garage. He then gave me an amulet (charm), which I threw inside my pocket. Later on, we met and he asked me to accompany him to a place called Kwata.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWhen we got to the area, we saw two young girls at a location. We stopped and called them. Wada now removed a handkerchief from his pocket and flashed it on the face of one of the girls. After the girl had slumped, he took her into an uncompleted structure, and removed her organs, as dire</p>

<p>A High Court in Kenya on Wednesday ordered over N454million (KSh100 million) that was confiscated from a Nigerian national, Muazu Bala, at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to be deposited at Central Bank of Kenya.</p>



<p>According to KenyaReport, Bala was arrested at the airport last Friday with the cash, with the Assets and Recovery Agency, suspecting it could be proceeds of crime or money laundering.</p>



<p>ARA had on Tuesday filed a case in court seeking orders to freeze the cash.<br>The money seized from Bala last Friday is in three denominations; US dollars (880,000), Euros (60,000) and Naira (63,000).</p>



<p>‚ÄúTo effectively investigate the matter, DCI Transnational Organized Crime Detectives are working with the ARA. The seized cash is believed to be from International Criminal Cartels,‚Äù says the DCI.</p>



<p>‚ÄúHis failure to declare that he was carrying such a huge amount or documents to support the legitimacy of the cash, raises suspicion of money laundering,‚Äù says ARA.</p>



<p>In court documents, Bala said the cash was for conducting business in Dubai.<br>However, he did not have any supporting documents on the nature of the said business, or authorisation to move large amounts of cash.</p>



<p>At most international airports, one must declare currency of over $10,000 (about Ksh1 million). While having large amounts of cash is technically not illegal, failure to declare it can lead to forfeiture.</p>

<p>Justice Agatha Okeke of the Federal High Court, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, on Monday, November 30, 2020, committed one Dr. Bassey Goddy Usen to 14 years imprisonment without option of fine.</p>



<p>Usen, a medical doctor and managing director, Ceephass Diagnostic Clinic/Surgery was prosecuted by the Uyo Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC), on a two-count charge of obtaining by false pretence to the tune of N5 million.</p>



<p>One of the charges read, &#8220;That you, Bassey Goddy Usen, the Managing Director of Ceephass Diagnostic Clinic/Surgery on or about the 18th April, 2017 in Uyo, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court with intent to defraud, obtained the sum of N2,000,000.00 (Two million naira) from one Edodiong Essien under the pretence that the money will be used to execute contracts awarded to you by Akwa Ibom State Hospital Management Board, Uyo; a pretence you knew to be false and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 1 (1) (a) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act 2006 and punishable under Section 1 (3) of the same Act&#8221;.</p>



<p>His ‚Äúnot guilty,‚Äù plea set the stage for his trial which commenced on October 24, 2018.</p>



<p>In the cause of the trial, prosecution counsel, Agbo S. Abuh presented four witnesses and tendered various exhibits which were admitted in evidence, and closed its case on February 28.</p>



<p>Delivering judgement on Monday, Justice Okeke noted that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and sentenced the defendant to seven years imprisonment on each of the two-count charges.</p>



<p>Though there was no option of fine, the prison terms will run concurrently with effect from the day of his arrest.</p>



<p>In addition, the convict would restitute the sum of N3 million to his victim as a condition for his release upon completion of his jail term.</p>



<p>Usen &#8216;s journey to prison began in 2018, when his victim, Edodiong Essien petitioned the EFCC, alleging that the convict approached him for a loan to enable him execute a contract, purportedly awarded to him by Akwa Ibom State Hospitals Management Board for the supply of drugs to rural hospitals in the state.</p>



<p>While his claim for the loan is false, as the convict‚Äôs name did not feature as a contractor with the state‚Äôs Hospital Management Board, he flouted the terms of repayment, and furthermore, issued his victim with dud cheques.</p>

<p>Abubakar Mohammed Sani, a serving Deputy Comptroller of Nigerian Correctional Service, NCoS, was today arraigned by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, before Justice Hadiza Sabi‚Äôu Shagari of the Federal High Court Katsina on a six count charge of conspiracy and obtaining by false pretense.</p>



<p>The defendant allegedly used his position as an officer of the Katsina Command of theNigerian Prisons Service (as it then was) and obtained a total sum of N2,850,000 (Two Million Eight Hundred and Fifty Thousand Naira ) from some persons under the guise of helping them secure employment into the Prison Service.</p>



<p>Upon receipt of the complaints against the Officer, the Commission swung into action by inviting him but the defendant was evasive until August 26 , 2020, when he finally reported. After questioning, he was granted administrative bail on self recognizance which he later abused and absconded. Consequently his arraignment was twice adjourned due to his absence in court.</p>



<p>On Wednesday November 11, 2020, operatives of the Commission tracked and arrested him in Abuja after which he was moved to the Kano Office of the Commission.</p>



<p>The charge against the defendant read that you, ‚Äú Abubakar Mohammed Sani while being Deputy Comptroller of the Nigerian Prison Service (now Nigerian Correctional Service) on or about 20 December, 2012 in Katsina within the Jurisdiction of this Honourable Court with intent to defraud obtained the sum of N305,000 (Three Hundred and Five Thousand Naira Only) which you caused to be deposited into your UBA account number 2030252055 under the pretense of securing a job for Umar Himma, Surajo Ibrahim and Abubakar Gambo in the Nigerian Prison Service now (Nigerian Correctional Service), which pretense you knew to be false and you thereby committed an offense contrary to section 1(1)(a) and punishable under section 1(3) of the Advance Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act 2006‚Äù.</p>



<p>The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge.In view of his plea, the prosecuting counsel, Usman Shehu requested the court for a trial date. But the defense counsel, G.U Jafaru applied to move a motion for bail on behalf of the defendant.The court allowed the motion as the prosecution had already filed a 12-paragraph counter affidavit, opposing the bail application.</p>



<p>However, the court sought to know if the defense counsel had filed a further affidavit in response to the prosecution‚Äôs counter affidavit. He said he did but the prosecuting counsel informed the court that he had not been served with the further affidavit.</p>



<p>Consequently, the court ruled that the motion was not ripe for hearing until all correspondence are before the court.</p>



<p>The court remanded the defendant in EFCC custody and adjourned the matter till December 1, 2020 for hearing of the bail application.</p>

<p>Armed thugs on Thursday chased away hundreds of anti-insecurity protesters in Kano.</p>



<p>The Protest organized across the Northern states by the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) against the lingering insecurity challenges bedeviling the north, couldn‚Äôt go far as the heavily armed thugs launched an attack on them.</p>



<p>CNG gathered along Bayero University, Kano road to proceed with the protest, but some hoodlums descended on them, beating and snatching their phones until they took to their hills for safety.</p>



<p>A member of the group, Usaini Adamu narrated that the thugs, brandishing dangerous weapons invaded the gathering, opposite BUK old campus and started attacking tmembers of the CNG.</p>



<p>Though, according to Adamu, no casualty in the attack, but a few of the members had sustained minor injuries, adding that they were saved by the prompt intervention of security agents.</p>



<p>‚ÄúOnly a few of us sustained some minor injuries because security operatives promptly intervened and dispersed them.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe were grouping here, suddenly these thugs descended on us and started beating us. Most of us scampered for safety while some of us resisted until security agents arrived and dispersed them.</p>



<p>‚ÄúNow the security agents have given us a cover to read our press statement and leave,‚Äù said Adamu.</p>



<p>In a released signed by the CNG‚Äôs spokesman, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman and circulated across the North, the group said the aim was to show concern for deteriorating national security and other pressing issues.</p>



<p>According to CNG, it decided to stage the protest to express concern on the dwindling economy, prohibitive commodity prices, rising inflation amid mounting poverty and prolonged stay at home by university students.</p>



<p>The group also expressed sadness about how northern leaders and politicians had neglected the region and its population, while the southern leaders help their people at the time of need.</p>



<p>‚ÄúThat while the southern elected and appointed leaders and representatives are quick to identify with their people at the time of need, their counterparts from the North, including the President, the Senate President, Senators, Rep members, governors, state legislators and other government appointees would rather abandon the hundreds of thousands of people in northern communities exposed to crime, lawlessness and insecurity in the hands of bandits, insurgents, kidnappers, rapists rustlers, and other violent criminals without any form of protection.</p>



<p>‚ÄúThat it is contradictory that despite several protests and pleas by northerners, the authorities never deemed it fit to extend the swift spirit deployed against FSARS into securing the North, or addressing the myriad distresses faced by northerners.</p>



<p>NEWS:&nbsp; Kaduna govts reopens schools<br />‚ÄúThat the authorities appear bent on sustaining the harsh, unacceptable regime of exploitative hikes in electricity tariffs for which the North shall bear the brunt more than other parts of the country. That the federal government appears not keen on resolving the lingering dispute with the Academic Staff Union to enable the recommencement of university education,‚Äù said CNG.</p>



<p>While calling on all its northern chapters to embark on the protests, CNG also called on the federal government to immediately declare a state of emergency on security and take practical steps to end all manifestations of insecurity in northern Nigeria and other parts of the country.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe demand thorough reorientation of the entire police force and its empowerment by way of additional personnel, modern training and adequate equipment to be able to reclaim its universal internal security function.</p>



<p>‚Äù We would mount pressure on leaders to show real commitment to protecting lives of citizens, ending the prolonged closure of our universities, reconsidering hiked commodity prices, reducing youth unemployment, and checking the rise in poverty level.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe publicly condemn and pass a vote of no confidence on those office holders and elected leaders who have abandoned the bulk of northerners to the mercy of a vicious insurgency, destructive banditry, rape and sexual assaults, violent communal clashes amidst mounting poverty and entrenched fear of widespread kidnappings for ransom.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe call on the federal government to declare the agreement reached by labour with the government on new electricity tariff unacceptable and demand the immediate and unconditional reversal to the old rates,‚Äù CNG stated.</p>



<p>While welcoming the creation of the SWAT to replace SARS, CNG also called for expeditious action for the improvement of the professionalism of the personnel to be drafted through reinforcement, retraining, equipment update and improved welfare.</p>
