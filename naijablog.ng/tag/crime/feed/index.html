<p>The police say they have arrested a member of the six-man armed robbery gang that stole a vehicle with Diplomatic Registration Number. The suspect, Emmanuel Okoi, 29, was arrested at a pharmacy in the Maitama District area of Nigeria’s Federal Capital Territory on Thursday.</p>



<p>A statement by the FCT Command&#8217;s spokesperson, DSP Josephine Adeh, said the vehicle was recovered within seven hours after the offence was committed.<br>The suspect was identified as Emmanuel Okoi, 29. The PPRO regretted that the robbers shot and killed one man who had intervened during the attack</p>



<p>Adeh said, &#8220;The FCT Police Command on Thursday, October 13, at about 15:30hrs after an all-night pursuit and an aggressive man-hunt of Armed hoodlums, recovered the Maitama gun-point stolem vehicle and arrested one suspect.<br>Recall that on October 12, 2022, at about 20:00hrs, two residents, a male and a female, drove into a pharmacy in the Maitama District area of the FCT.</p>



<p>While the female proceeded into the pharmacy, the male remained by the car waiting. It was thereafter reported that some armed hoodlums numbering about 6 came in a Mazda vehicle and forced him into Toyota Landcruiser Jeep with Diplomatic Registration Number GD CD 071, and took off with him.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Command&#8217;s spokesperson further stated, &#8220;Unfortunately, a passerby who attempted to come to his aid was shot in the head and later confirmed dead at the Maitama District Hospital. Seven hours later, the painstaking effort of the Command yielded results as the stolen vehicle was recovered at Jabi magajipi, off Eco Bank Junction Jabi, while one Emmanuel Okoi, a 29-year-old male resident of Jabi and a suspected member of the criminal syndicate was arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>A businessman identified as Badejo Ranti has been arrested by operatives of the Ogun State police command in connection with the death of his wife, Afolashade Taibat Adewusi.</p>



<p>It was gathered that the incident happened on Tuesday, October 11 at their residence in Mowe, Ogun State. A source familiar with the incident reports, “They’ve been married for 7 years and on Tuesday an argument ensued over school fees for their kids. Badejo had stormed out of the house in anger and returned later that night to meet his sleeping wife.</p>



<p>Still infuriated over the argument they had, he powered an iron and used it on her body till she gave up the ghost. Neighbors who had heard the wife screamed for help rushed to their apartment and the suspect claimed she died as a result of electricution. We handed him over to the police before irate eyewitnesses took laws into their own hands.”</p>



<p>In a video, the deceased can be seen laying dead on the floor with severe b¥rns all over her body. Eyewitnesses can be heard expressing their anger over the unfortunate incident.</p>

<p>A peacemaker, identified as Peter Spencer Nwabuaze, has been stabbed to death while trying to separate two boys who were fighting in Asaba, Delta State.</p>



<p>It was gathered that the unfortunate incident occurred on Sunday morning, October 10, just four days after he relocated from Lagos State to Asaba with his pregnant wife and son.</p>



<p>According to a source, “His wife sent him to buy soap at a shop close to their house. On his way, he saw two boys fighting and he tried to separate them, but unfortunately he was stabbed to death.</p>



<p>The boys said it was a mistake. It was the hospital they rushed him to that called his wife to inform her of his death. Saddest part is that she’s heavily pregnant and they have a young son.</p>



<p>They were living in Satellite town, Lagos but moved to Asaba just four days ago.”</p>

<p>A staff of the Rivers State Television (RSTV) Glorious Abel has accused security officers attached to a Port Harcourt-based pastor, Senior Prophet U.O Miracle, of brutalising him.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/FB_IMG_1665410798922-473x630.jpg?resize=473%2C630&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-127012" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>Punch reported that the pastor had visited the Television office in Elelenwo in the company of his security detail at about 11pm on Thursday, October 6, when the incident occurred.</p>



<p>Narrating his ordeal, Abel said trouble started when the prophet sent a programme for airing to him through an aide last week.</p>



<p>&#8220;When he came, I checked the programme. It was about 38 minutes and above the normal time, we are supposed to put on the air. So to enable me to accommodate other programmes, I had to cut part of it,&#8221; he told the publication.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/FB_IMG_1665410790678-473x630.jpg?resize=473%2C630&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-127014" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>Abel who was the Operations Director on duty, further said while the programme was on, the prophet tried to reach him but could not get through because he had blocked him following previous cases which he describes as a disturbance.</p>



<p>&#8220;So he now used one of his aide’s numbers to call me. When he called me, he asked somebody to tell me to come outside my office. I replied that I can’t go outside because it was late, about past 10 pm. While I was inside doing my job, I heard another knock. When I got there I saw one of our security staff who told me that the acting General Manager of RSTV asked him to pick something from the reception stand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/FB_IMG_1665410795467-560x315.jpg?resize=560%2C315&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-127013" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>“I told him to show me what he wanted so that I could give it to him. But he insisted that I should open the office that the acting GM asked him to pick something inside. Immediately I opened the gate, I saw the pastor who came down from his car with some armed security men. They hit me with their gun and beat me up.</p>



<p>&#8220;As you can see, my face is swollen. They held me on the floor and beat me up. If I show you my back you will see scars. Then they took me to an unknown destination. The experience was terrible,” he said tearfully.</p>



<p>Spokesperson of the State Police Command, Grace Iringe-Koko, who confirmed the incident said said investigation was ongoing.</p>



<p>&#8220;The command is aware of the matter and we are investigating. Details of our investigations would be made public in the end,” she added.</p>
