<p>Her words read:</p>



<p>“ You can actually fall by lifting others, put a limit to how you help people. Don&#8217;t do too much, and never allow them guilt trip or manipulate you into getting money off you.” Chidinma</p>



<p>Truth be told these days just be careful how you give . You give and when you deny to give they try to manipulate you . Giving is a good thing but put a limit.</p>



<p>Again avoid making unnecessary sacrifices when you are still struggling . Let them call you names while you build . These days givers dey lack oh and when giver lack na people wey him help dey first laugh.</p>

<p>Popular Nigerian singer, Davido, has advised Nigerian leaders to do better in governing the country.</p>



<p>He gave this advice as he explained on his Instagram Story why he always returns to Nigeria after his shows abroad.</p>



<p>He spoke on how blessed Nigeria is and recalled how when he was younger, he would tell his parents that he wanted to return to Nigeria whenever they went on vacation in America.</p>



<p>‘’People always wonder why I fly back home after gigs. Funny enough when we used to come to America on holiday as a kid l&#8217;d cry to my parents that I wanna go back to Naija. Really love being in Nigeria. Even if I have 4 hours to be in Naija, I go run am! No place like! Our leaders need to do better, the country is blessed.’’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Davido is a product of generational wealth created by his great grand mother Madam Adeboyin &#8211; a wealthy Iyalode.</p>



<p>Davido&#8217;s great grand mother was an Iyalode &#8211; head of a Yoruba market.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the same title Ahmed Tinubu&#8217;s mother held which was transferred to Tinubu&#8217;s daughter.</p>



<p>This title is a definition of wealth.</p>



<p>Davido&#8217;s great grand mother gave birth to Davido&#8217;s grand father Ayoola Adeleke who stood on the wealth of his mother to become a 1st Republic senator in Nigeria. Davido&#8217;s grand father was rich &#8211; very rich and gave his children, Davido&#8217;s father and his uncles the best education in America etc.</p>



<p>The story of Davido&#8217;s father raising the Osun State Governor elect is incorrect because they all inherited ANCESTRAL wealth.</p>



<p>Davido&#8217;s father and uncle&#8217;s are half Igbo and half Yoruba. This explains why Davido&#8217;s best friends are Igbos because his ancestral maternal home is Enugu.</p>



<p>Davido&#8217;s father and uncles were born and raised in Enugu by an Igbo mother.</p>



<p>The Adeleke family is a dynasty with ancestral wealth. The difference between such families and yours is that while they inherited welath, you inherited poverty. So comparing their family with yours is unfair to yourself.</p>



<p>Poverty is the reason why families fight. When resources are not enough, people become selfish.</p>



<p>But where there&#8217;s enough wealth, there&#8217;s no reason for unnecessary fights. This is why you see people like Elon Musk get huge support from his family when he starts new companies but your own family members would tear you down when you try to build something new. Elon Musk comes from wealth and nobody in his entire family is poor and thus needs nothing from him.</p>



<p>Be kind to yourself….</p>



<p>Understand why you are struggling &#8211; the whole blame is not on you &#8211; your ancestors share part of the blame.</p>



<p>If you come from a poor lineage, BE KIND TO YOURSELF. YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING NOBODY IN YOUR ENTIRE LINEAGE HAS EVER ACHIEVED OR EVEN ATTEMPTED. YOU ARE LIVING IN HOMES YOUR ANCESTORS NEVER ATTEMPTED TO LIVE IN. YOU ARE DRIVING CARS YOUR ANCESTORS NEVER DREAMT OF DRIVING. HONEY, YOU ARE BREAKING RECORDS. BE PROUD OF YOURSELF.</p>



<p>My name is #CharlesAwuzie and I am a student of wealth and a researcher on poverty.</p>

<p>Singer, Davido, has said a prayer for the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) after he congratulated his uncle and winner of the Osun governorship election, Ademola Adeleke.</p>



<p>Buhari had said that the results of the election reflected the will of Osun people.</p>



<p>He said, “The people of Osun have expressed their will through the ballot. This is what democracy is all about: respect for the will of the people. The successful conduct of #OsunDecides2022 is a demonstration of the maturity and the commitment of all stakeholders, towards strengthening the integrity of the electoral process in Nigeria.</p>



<p>“I remain fully committed to leaving behind a legacy of credible elections in Nigeria.”</p>



<p>Quoting the last line of the retired general’s tweet, Davido said, “You will leave a LASTING legacy! God bless you for this act alone sir!”</p>
