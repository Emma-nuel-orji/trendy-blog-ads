<p>Conversion Strategy: How To Make Money From Old House in Nigeria by Dennis Isong</p>



<p>Nigeria has experienced a surge in real estate development over the years,and with conversion properties emerging as a lucrative investment avenue. The conversion of existing structures into alternative uses presents a unique opportunity for investors to capitalize on the evolving landscape of the Nigerian real estate market. In this article, we delve into the concept of conversion properties in Nigeria and explore the financial benefits associated with this innovative investment strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conversion properties involve the transformation of existing structures for purposes other than their original design or use. In Nigeria, this can encompass repurposing commercial spaces into residential units, renovating old warehouses into trendy office spaces, or adapting heritage buildings for modern purposes. This adaptive reuse not only adds value to the property but also contributes to sustainable urban development.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">FINANCIAL BENEFITS OF CONVERSION PROPERTIES IN NIGERIA:</h1>



<ul>
<li>Cost-Effectiveness:</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversion properties often come with cost advantages compared to ground-up developments. Renovating an existing structure is typically more cost-effective than constructing a new building. This cost efficiency allows investors to allocate resources strategically and potentially increase profit margins.</p>



<ul>
<li>Faster Returns on Investment (ROI):</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversion process is generally quicker than starting a project from scratch. With less time spent on obtaining permits and navigating regulatory hurdles, investors can realize returns on their investment faster. This speedier ROI is particularly attractive in a dynamic market like Nigeria&#8217;s, where trends can change rapidly.</p>



<ul>
<li>Diversification of Portfolio:</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including conversion properties in an investment portfolio offers diversification benefits. Investors can balance their risk exposure by incorporating different types of real estate assets. The diversity inherent in conversion properties allows investors to tap into multiple market segments, creating a resilient investment portfolio.</p>



<ul>
<li>Meeting Changing Demands:</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigeria&#8217;s evolving demographics and urbanization trends have led to changing demands for real estate. Conversion properties provide a flexible solution to meet these changing needs. By repurposing existing structures, investors can align their investments with current market demands, ensuring sustained relevance and profitability.</p>



<ul>
<li>Contributing to Sustainable Development:</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repurposing existing structures aligns with sustainable development goals. Investors in conversion properties can benefit from positive public perception and government incentives aimed at promoting environmentally conscious practices. This alignment with sustainability principles can enhance the long-term value and marketability of the property.</p>



<ul>
<li>Enhanced Value and Appeal:</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well-executed conversion projects have the potential to enhance the aesthetic and functional appeal of a property. This increased value can translate into higher rental or resale prices, maximizing the financial returns for investors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF CONVERSION PROPERTIES&nbsp;</h2>



<p>1. Regulatory Compliance:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Navigating regulatory requirements can be challenging, given the diversity of Nigerian states and local authorities. Investors must thoroughly understand and comply with zoning laws, building codes, and other regulations to avoid delays and potential legal issues.</p>



<p>2. Market Research and Due Diligence:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conducting thorough market research and due diligence is essential for identifying viable conversion opportunities. Understanding local market trends, demand dynamics, and competition will help investors make informed decisions and mitigate risks associated with potential oversaturation or changing market conditions.</p>



<p>3. Infrastructure and Accessibility:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing the existing infrastructure and accessibility of a property is crucial for its success. Investors should consider the availability of essential services, transportation links, and the overall infrastructure to ensure the property&#8217;s attractiveness to potential tenants or buyers.</p>



<p>4. Financing Challenges:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While conversion projects can be cost-effective, securing financing may still pose challenges. Investors should explore various financing options, including partnerships, loans, and government incentives, to ensure sufficient capital for successful project completion.</p>



<p>5. Adaptability to Market Trends:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real estate market is dynamic, and trends can shift rapidly. Investors in conversion properties must stay attuned to market changes and be prepared to adapt their projects to align with emerging demands and preferences.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CASE STUDIES AND SUCCESS STORIES</h2>



<p>Examining successful conversion projects in Nigeria can provide valuable insights and inspiration for prospective investors. Learning from the experiences of others can help identify best practices, potential pitfalls, and innovative approaches to maximize the financial benefits of conversion properties.</p>



<p>Residential Conversions:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transforming underutilized commercial spaces into modern residential units has gained popularity in Nigeria&#8217;s urban centers. Successful projects have demonstrated the potential for higher rental yields and increased property values in response to the growing demand for contemporary living spaces.</p>



<p>Office Space Revitalization:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Converting outdated office buildings into vibrant coworking spaces or tech hubs has proven successful in attracting innovative businesses. This adaptive reuse not only revitalizes the property but also contributes to the development of dynamic, collaborative work environments.</p>



<p>Heritage Building Preservation:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repurposing historic buildings for commercial or cultural uses has become a trend in preserving Nigeria&#8217;s architectural heritage. Investors engaging in such projects often benefit from government incentives, positive public perception, and the unique charm associated with historic properties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>That is Real Estate investment?Â </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Real estate investment is the purchase, management, and sale or rental of real estate with the intent to make a profit whether immediate or in the long run. Real estate appreciates over time. Property bought four years ago has more value now if you intend to sell it and the more you leave it year in, year out, the more the value appreciates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Real estate is the new oil money as it brings fortune if done right and can be the beginning of generational wealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, you can easily make mistakes if care is not taken or you lack the right information.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of the mistakes can be:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b> Not taking time to get adequate information</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not all property is good to invest in. The problem is not even with the property but oftentimes, with the location. If you buy a property as a means of investment in a place that has not much value because of circumstances surrounding it, you may find it difficult to sell or make your money from it. This is where adequate information comes in. You need to have much-needed information before investing in any property. Do your research and due diligence so it doesnât end as a waste of money or property that yields little or no value.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><b> Meeting the wrong property vendor</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many people have fallen into this unawares till they are left with nothing. There are many fake vendors out there posing as real estate sellers. If you meet them, unfortunately, your money is gone. This is why property companies are highly recommended. At least, you know who you are dealing with has a structure.</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><b> Being ignorant of all documents involved in buying a property</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you want to buy a property as a first-timer, research all documents you are supposed to be given, or better still, employ the services of a property lawyer.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You may end up losing a property to the dreaded omo-onile if you donât have the complete or original documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of these mistakes are mostly made by investors buying a property for the first time but you can avoid them only if you are properly informed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Letâs look at the pros and cons of property investment</span></p>
<p><b>PROS</b></p>
<p><b>i.Steady cash inflow</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Investing in rental property is one of the most beneficial investments you can ever make because of how it keeps yielding a return on investment all year round. Some landlords do prefer monthly payments. Imagine having 3 or more tenants paying into your account every month, that should make anyone happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, this applies to an investor leasing out a property.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b> Long-term Security</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If your property is on government-approved land, then, there is nothing to worry about. Your investment is permanent and will continue to yield profit forever. You can rest assured of financial security for a very long time.</span></p>
<p><b>iii. The value keeps appreciating</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When you invest in a property like land, it keeps appreciating yearly. Take, for instance, Ibeju-Lekki. Ibeju-Lekki was not a hot cake a few years ago but then, look at it now, Ibeju-Lekki is one of the most sought-after places in Lagos when it comes to buying properties (whether land or structure).</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b> You can decide to keep it for as long as you want</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For people who would like to keep something worthwhile down for their children, this is best for you. Investing in property for keeps is a great option with a great financial benefit. Imagine buying land for 500,000 when your child is still 2 years old only to hand it over when he/she turns 25. Calculate how big it would have appreciated in a space of 23years.</span></p>
<p><b>v.It doesnât have to move with you</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike other valuable property which you may need to sell off or gift out if you are relocating abroad, land and structure-property do not have to be disposed of in that form. You could decide to make it yield in absentia. For instance, rent out the structure or lease out land to farmers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">CONS</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b> High maintenance</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyone involved in property investment should know that it cost so much to maintain unless you donât mind having a property looking awful, of course, this would affect the value being placed on it. For example, rental property.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b> It involves a large capitalÂ </b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Property investment is no joke. You could empty your account just to invest in property and this doesnât mean you would get the returns in multiples almost immediately. For land to give you a much-needed return, it has to wait a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a rental property to yield the money invested + profits, it would take some years as well. So, when you heavily invest, you also need to consider that patience is a virtue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suffice to say, property investment is worth every bit of it. Itâs an investment you can rely on come rain, come sunshine. If you have not considered it before, I guess itâs time you start thinking about it. And not just think, take a profitable step!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-73475d3b-7fff-1e81-57b7-650fcce3f975" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">There is so much excitement that comes with leaving a country like Nigeria. Some of the reasons for this are that people feel, at last, they are free from the hardship, insecurity, etc. that have eaten deep into the country.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">Itâs common for people to want to sell their properties for various reasons. Some do it as a means to get more money to travel with, while some do so because they feel they no longer need the property since they donât intend to come back to Nigeria anymore.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">When Mr. Phillip and his family wanted to relocate, there were two houses available that they owned. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">He was bent on selling them but his wife advised against it. She thought that since her husband has a trusted person who could be in charge, they should rather rent them out and still get their return on investment in absentia. Mr. Phillip didnât agree. He just didnât care about the country or anything it has to offer anymore.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;"> This is understandable. A lot of people would prefer to do away with anything that could give them stress once they step out of Nigeria. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">So, he sold them and they all traveled out. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">The first few months were quite rocky for them because Mr. Phillip couldnât get a job on time which was not envisaged. The bills were on his wife and she got choked at some point. Then, he thought about the houses he sold. If he had maintained and rented at least one of them, something, even if not much would come in for him.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">Like I said earlier, when people decide to leave every form of baggage in Nigeria, we canât blame them. However, we need to see beyond the immediate excitement and have a better understanding of how our steps can either be advantageous to us or not. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">So, what should you do instead of selling off your properties? </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">If you are not selling because you desperately need money, then you should read thisâ¦</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;">
<h1>1. Rent that property out</h1>
<h1></h1>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">This should be given consideration. There are many house owners abroad, so this isnât a bad idea. I would advise that you make rent payments monthly. Asides from that itâs favorable to you because your account will be permanently credited by tenants monthly, it also helps your tenants as well. Monthly payment is a relief to most people because they can easily take it out from their salaries if they are salary earners than paying all at once by the time their rent expires. So, itâs a win-win. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">You may not be in Nigeria, but your property still fetches you money and thatâs the most important thing.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;">
<h1>2. Lease it out</h1>
<h1></h1>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">For people who would like to use the property for various reasons such as making it a school, church, offices, etc., you will be doing yourself a favor by leasing it out to them. Of course, itâs a contract with an agreement. You could make it a few years and this makes you rest assured that you have an income from Nigeria and apart from this if you decide to come back to Nigeria, you will find the property intact. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;">
<h2>3. Convert the property</h2>
<h2></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">I donât think there&#8217;s anything wrong with having a business here and living abroad. A lot of people might feel discouraged but itâs worth giving it a try. You could convert the property to a mini-mall, bookshop, or studio. Since you wonât be there, this is what you should do: liaise with someone who needs space and has the required skill and experience to run the business. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">Equip or store up the place, then have an agreement of a percentage you should be expecting. To people in Nigeria, the person is the owner, meanwhile, he is just standing in for you in the form of a partnership.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">This is what we call sleeping while your money works for you.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;">
<h2>4. Make it a home for tourists</h2>
<h2></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">Just like a short-let apartment, you can make it a place of rest for tourists. However, this works if there are tourist sights in that city. Also, this is making your property in the form of a mini-hotel. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">Although, you canât do this without having some things in place before traveling. And if the expenses will be overwhelming for you, find an investor who might be interested in that business.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;">
<h2>5. Make it an event center</h2>
<h2></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">This largely depends on the size of the property. But for simple events such as seminars, workshops, low-key weddings, etc., your property can fit in. itâs just that you need a representative and staff to help you run it in your absence.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">In conclusion, your property can still make money for you. Donât be in a hurry to sell it off. I know a bigger challenge might be finding a trustworthy fellow to stand in with all honesty. However, I believe you know a lot of people and out of them, there should be at least one good person to do the job.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.7999999999999998; background-color:#ffffff; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt; padding:19.0pt0.0pt19.0pt0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#212529; background-color:transparent; font-weight:700; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">Dennis Isong helps individuals invest right in Real estate.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Almost every state in Nigeria has several old apartments that have been in existence for decades. Some apartments are demolished while some are renovated. But no matter how old your building is, if you do the right thing(s), renters will come for it.</p>



<p>If you wonder why people are leaving your house or not placing much value on it, you may need to ask, and most times, they are even glaring to you.</p>



<p>A house popularly known as four flats in Lagos was built 30 years ago. Imagine the cost of that compared to now and compare the market value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the problem was that the children of the chief (he is late now) that built it didnât care so much about it. All they wanted was just the rent payments. Gradually, renters started leaving the place for a better place. When the property was left for over a year without any occupant, they decided to sell it off. The lucky buyer who saw a greater prospect in the property stripped off the structure, renovated it, and added all modern facilities to it.</p>



<p>Within some months, the property became the talk of the street. It didnât take up to a month before the flats got filled up with tenants.</p>



<p>Sometimes, property owners hardly realize that they are sitting on gold. You can improve your property in various ways that could attract renters to you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Renovate the property</h2>



<p>One of the ways to make your property attractive to rent is by renovation. Naturally, people prefer and gravitate towards houses that look new. A renovated property stands a higher chance of having potential rentersâ attention.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Use modern facilities</h2>



<p>When you renovate, donât miss out on modern facilities. For instance, if the property has a terrazzo flooring, you may need to switch to tiles. Houses with pit toilets can be changed to WC (Water closet). There is a lot you can incorporate into your property that increases the property value and attracts renters.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Be creative/ start a catchy business</h2>



<p>You could create a store at the front of the property where you let it out to someone who wants to sell every household item. Having a store like a mini-mart on your property attracts renters because no one likes to go through the stress of buying what they need out of their vicinity. If your property has a mini-mart facility, itâs sure that you can get tenants sooner than expected.</p>



<p>Also, you may create a viewing center depending on how large the property is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Paint in an attractive color</h2>



<p>Colors are vital parts of a building. Good and attractive painting brings peopleâs attention to the property. Naturally, we have the eyes for beautiful house colors and this should be considered in&nbsp; the process of renovation.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Donât make the initial payment too expensive</h2>



<p>While letting out your property, there is a temptation to want to put the price on the high side because you are considering how far you have invested in it. Yes, people may be interested in it but likely take a longer time to rent out if itâs too expensive which isnât good.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Consider buying a central generator</h2>



<p>This can be a big plus on your rental property. Itâs not strange that we live in a country still struggling with power supply, having a central generator in your rented property is not a bad idea. For that alone, renters will be more interested in your house than any other house on the street.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Create a consistent water system</h2>



<p>In some communities, water is a major problem. Water scarcity happens due to some factors. The only viable solution to this problem is installing a borehole machine. Renters can do anything to be in a house where the water supply is available constantly.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Make it look neater</h2>



<p>You need to see some houses and how extremely dirty and unkempt they are. Itâs an extreme sport getting any interested renters. A house with a dirty environment is a huge turn-off to potential renters. To be realistic, itâs degrading to have a house looking haunted because of dirt especially, the clogged and piled-up dirt that has blocked the drainage system.</p>

<p>Many Nigerians living in diaspora have reservations against buying and owning a property in Nigeria. Your fears are valid! People living abroad have gone through a lot of traumatizing situations in an attempt to be a property owner in Nigeria.</p>



<p>Mrs. Abiola has been scammed twice just to buy a property in Nigeria. Firstly, it was an outsider, then, she felt she had overstepped her boundary by involving an outsider. Then, she trusted her relative to do better, unfortunately, she was wrong to trust a relative too. Her relative duped her as well. Mrs. Abiola made a decision never to trust anyone when it comes to buying a property in Nigeria. Can we blame her?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Doctor Williams family lost all their savings and when they involved the Nigerian judicial system, it was learnt that the scammers bribed their way to freedom, leaving Doctor Williams stranded.</p>



<p>Jide from Cairo even tried to invest in a company, but, quite unfortunate, he got his money stuck in the company. He wasnât aware that the company wasnât a registered one before investing with them.</p>



<p>These stories and many more can be quite discouraging most especially for someone not living in Nigeria to see things for themselves.</p>



<p>Despite all these, there are still Nigerians in diaspora that have properties here in absentia.</p>



<p>&nbsp;What did they do right? Letâs find out from Dennis Isong, founder LandProperty.ng&nbsp;</p>



<p>Question- can you please introduce yourself?</p>



<p>Dennis Isong- my name is Dennis Isong, founder LandProperty.Ng. I am a real estate professional and mogul that has all the experience, exposure, connection, tactics and wherewithal to help you do the following:</p>



<p>-Purchase and Sales of properties by linking you (especially if you are not in Nigeria) up with genuine property company, and monitor the transaction process. I serve as your eye and representative that sees to buying property which will not be a problem whether now or later. And also, guide you from getting duped</p>



<p>-I provide adequate information and direction concerning property purchase and sale in Lagos.</p>



<p>-My Real Estate company also does Property Education and Enlightenment.</p>



<p>-Being a Real Estate professional and mogul, I serve as a guide that can help you get property in Lagos, Nigeria.</p>



<p>-I offer free consultation services for anyone who wishes to invest in Lagos Nigeria but confused, uninformed and at a crossroad.</p>



<p>Question- can you expatiate on what you mean by property education and enlightenment?</p>



<p>Dennis Isong- thank you! Just about a year after I launched real estate business, I discovered that a whole lot of people carry on with wrong information and perception of the real estate, so, this has made them fall into wrong hands, make mistakes and lose so much money. And then, I thought and asked myselfâ how can I salvage this situation, how do I proffer solution to this?â Then, I came up with property education and enlightenment. Itâs impossible to enlighten people just as you meet them because there are too many people that need to know the right thing. So, the best way to go about it is by using the social media which has the capacity to reach a larger audience.</p>



<p>Question- why do we keep hearing a case of property fraud in Nigeria?</p>



<p>Dennis Isong- like I explained in the previous question, lack of knowledge can be a great factor. There was a case that happened few years ago, a particular property has been going through court proceedings for a while without the hope that it would get settled anytime soon. One of the family members, the uncle of the original property owner who had died, was losing patience with the court, so, he decided to sell and run off to Ghana with the money. The buyer didnât make his due diligence before putting his money on it because he trusted the seller due to the fact that they were from the same hometown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before I proceed, I would like to say this, when it comes to buying properties, take away every form of sentiments. Sentiment would pull you back from asking the right questions and finding out some blurry circumstances for better understanding.</p>



<p>Back to the man. He bought the land and this uncle didnât even wait a minute before absconding. It was then the buyer discovered that the case of the land is in court and cannot be sold until it is resolved.</p>



<p>Although, the uncle was later apprehended in Kebbi state after two years. Imagine, a land sold in Lagos.</p>



<p>Question- How do we trust you? People have been scammed a lot, so, itâs important for people to know that they are not taking another wrong decision.</p>



<p>Dennis Isong âI have come across a lot of people who came and were afraid because of their previous experiences with scammers. Let me give you an instance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was a woman, I wonât mention her name but we do call her Alhaja. Alhaji gave us the most difficult time. The first problem we had with her was not trusting us. Nothing we said was acceptable and at a point, I told my team to let her be and work on her request. Our outcome will do the talking, not our verbal conversation.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I wouldnât blame Alhaja though. When I am meeting a client for the first time, I love to always hear about their past experience(s) if they had any and chose to share. This is my strong style of connecting with a client.</p>



<p>So, she told me about how people saw that she was wealthy and had money to throw around. She explained how people took advantage of that and her being uneducated to have a share of her when sheâs not a national cake. Family and friends had, according to the Nigerian term,â run her street. âThis happened for 15 years.</p>



<p>&nbsp;But she is just a âstubbornâ person who is determined to have as many properties as she can lay her hands on. One of our clients recommended us to her but she canât just trust us.</p>



<p>When we delivered, she was astonished. You need to see the look on her face! She then apologized to us and even gave I and my team some money for the weekend.</p>



<p>I have a lot of testimonies but wonât want to bore you. In summary, we have always delivered and will continue to do so. You can check our activities via the internet. Type my name on the search engine, I guarantee that you wonât find any negative review.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I am registered which you can find on google. I have been running the real estate business for a number of years now. My company has a track record of excellence with lots of testimonies which I will be willing to show you. If you want to find out beyond the internet about how genuine our company is, you can run your check from the Lagos secretariat.</p>



<p>Question â If I buy a property, can I pay by installment just to be sure that you are genuine because I know scammers like to get their money once?</p>



<p>Dennis Isong- A lot of people have brought property through installment and not allocated. There are companies that use that as a fraud and thatâs why you need a Real Estate professional like me to help you filter all those companies who are not genuine in doing business in Lagos, Nigeria. I am coming in as an advisor to make you take the right decision. Yes, you can if the property company I am linking you to offers the mode of payment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main thing here is for you to follow my lead.</p>



<p>Question â How do people go about the documents when not available?</p>



<p>Dennis Isong â this aspect gets people living abroad so bothered. We once had a client who told us that she would get back after discussing and reaching on an agreement. We didnât know that she was trying to find someone to help her to have all the papers done and get them sent to her. It took months for us to know why she went AWOL. So, I had to enlighten her concerning part of the services I render which is taking over the aspect of documentation and getting them across to her abroad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a nutshell, I offer these services especially for our clients abroad. Having your complete papers and sending them to you is not a problem.</p>



<p>Question â Can clients involve their own lawyer?</p>



<p>Dennis Isong â Yes, they can so far, the person is a property lawyer.</p>



<p>Question â Okay. If people buy land from you and decide to leave it to appreciate just to sell later, what assurance can you give them that such land would not be resold to another before the owner decided to sell it off?</p>



<p>Dennis Isong â that is why you need to buy from a reputable property company so that you will not fall into victim but if you buy land through omo-onile or an individual, it is advisable to take possession immediately by marking of territory. And this can be done by just building a simple, two-block fence round it. This advice is not strictly to my&nbsp; clients alone but for everyone that has a landed property. Asides this, any land gotten through me cannot be resold to any other person. Whether you are in Nigeria or not, you will definitely meet your land at any time you feel like selling it out or building on it.</p>



<p>Question- how can Dennis Isong help Nigerians in diaspora safeguard their properties here?</p>



<p>Dennis Isong- first of all, this part is what I have done for people over the years. Safeguarding your property is not a problem. I can guarantee maximum safety on any property bought through my real estate company by the name âLandProperty.NGâ. I and my team donât leave your property just because you have paid and handed over to you. We also monitor such property.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on our experience, we make sure that we guide you through so you can buy at the right company. We make sure that we verify property and after, we make sure that you are allocated, get all your documents which will be sent across to you abroad.</p>



<p>LandProperty.ng is a property company that has been in existence for over five years. We have served people both Nigeria and abroad and they have all been satisfied with doing business with us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We give you the right information. We donât try to sugarcoat or being desperate to sell to you. Our aim is to give you the best and nothing but the best.</p>



<p>Apart from guiding you concerning buying your property from genuine companies, we also write articles to synthetize, educate, and enlighten people so that they can know what to put their money on. We have realized, over the years that people make mistakes because of lack of information, most especially dealing with scammers whom they thought to be genuine? How then do we address that?</p>



<p>Itâs impossible to enlighten people as we meet them individually, thatâs where our weekly articles come in. At least, this reaches more people.</p>



<p>If you by chance come across my articles, kindly like, comment, and share.</p>

<p>A short-let apartment is a fully furnished luxury apartment that is rented for a short period, usually for months or weeks. Short-let apartments have been considered a quick way to get rich by some investors, unfortunately, not everyone knows about this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Short-let luxury apartments can be in:</p>



<p>â¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bungalow&nbsp;</p>



<p>â¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; duplex</p>



<p>â¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terrace&nbsp;</p>



<p>â¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detached&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>â¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; semi-detached&nbsp;</p>



<p>â¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; studio apartments</p>



<p>These kinds of apartments can be found in some selected places in Nigeria: Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Ibadan, etc. Because of its newness and lack of information, some investors are not aware of the benefit and profit, they stand to gain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Short let apartment which has been made as an alternative hotel accommodation presently has been a go-to accommodation choice most especially for travelers, tourists, and visitors in Nigeria. The accommodation can be for short/long stay leisure for business and at the same time, pleasure. Short-let homes are now great choices.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why is it profitable for investment?</h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Increase in property value</h2>



<p>People have stopped leaving their property vacant in recent times without getting any benefits/profits from it. Instead, they rather rent it out for months to make an extra income from it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, people would rather go for a short-let apartment than settle for a hotel because of the comfort and the feeling of home away from home they tend to get, unlike a hotel where you are left with few home appliances like a fridge, kettle, and TV.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A short-let apartment is made to be a home standard and thatâs why you can get full kitchen appliances and items to a well-furnished living room. Short-let apartments come with tasteful dÃ©cor and freedom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, before you invest in a short-let apartment, make sure that the location is favorable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Increase income potential</h2>



<p>Short-let apartments in Nigeria can also serve the benefit of a permanent and direct income stream. This is because the amount you make weekly or monthly is unlimited. Meanwhile, this can be achievable in places with high foot traffic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Flexibility in extending rent by tenants</h2>



<p>Most especially business people who travel out of their state can extend the duration of their stay when business meetings are being postponed. Hereby, generates more income.</p>



<p>When compared to hotel accommodation, short-let apartments are found to be more flexible reducing the stress of check-ins and outs, being confined to a particular room, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Short lets you get the feel of staying in a home at a much more affordable cost, you get access to amenities in the full apartment, you have access to a more serene interior and environment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. As a good source of finance</h2>



<p>Investors can leverage short-let properties as collateral when securing loans from banks for investment or business purposes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. High demand</h2>



<p>Short-let luxury apartments are now in high demand by travelers who want to enjoy the comfort of being in a home. Asides from this, short let&#8217;s become a getaway for a lot of people who want to relieve themselves of work stress and want to stay in an environment different from home.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Subject to increase rent charges</h2>



<p>Making a short-let investment more sophisticated by repainting, adding new technology, refining the interior finishing, and adding innovations, and features can as well increase cash flow because when all that is done, rental charges can be increased.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Buying a property is not as much as knowing where to buy the property. You can buy a property and end up discovering that the chosen area is a big mistake because of the lack of its profitability. There are certain features you should look out for when buying a property and one of them is its proximity to general amenities such as a popular hotel, shopping mall, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But we are focusing on a shopping mall in this article.</h2>



<p>Buying an apartment is always the first choice for people who are interested in getting started with a real estate investment. But with most investments, you have to start it right. An obvious choice for your real estate investment would be an apartment in a highly-urbanized area, specifically properties that are near shopping malls.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Easy access to products and items that are only available in shopping centers</h2>



<p>If you ask many people, they would tell you how tedious it is looking for household/personal needs to buy and not finding them close by. Itâs frustrating to go to your nearby store and then realize that they are all out of your favorite household brand. This is why itâs a big advantage to live in an apartment that is near a shopping center. You wonât have to worry about looking for a certain product or item because you know that the store has a lot of them in stock. Also, going from your apartment to the shopping center is just a few meters away, making the whole experience faster and more comfortable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Access to schools, parks, and other recreational facilities</h2>



<p>An area that has a mall facility is an area that bustles with activities. Such areas will have schools, parks, hospitals, etc around which makes having a property close by worthwhile.</p>



<p>Besides, these places are very convenient for a person with a growing family.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. A shopping center makes for a great landmark</h2>



<p>Landmarks are important features to look out for when buying a property. One of the biggest issues with moving to a new place is having to describe your new place. However, if youâre living right next to a shopping center or commercial district, you can easily tell your friends or family members to find the particular shopping center and call them out once theyâve arrived.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4.No problem with public transportation</h2>



<p>Unlike some places where getting transportation is an extreme sport because of where itâs located, property near a shopping mall does not have issues with that. Since itâs an area bustling with activities, you are sure of a good and active transport system.</p>



<p>It is very easy to pick up and sends off your visitors should they want to visit you in your apartment. The same can also be said for you when you need to commute either for work or travel.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Availability of many shops and restaurants near the shopping center</h2>



<p>You are open to choices and varieties because of the availability of shops and restaurants.</p>



<p>A shopping center is bound to have a lot of small shops and restaurants that you and your family can enjoy. Besides, who doesnât want to eat out in a fancy restaurant just a few meters away from your doorstep?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Your apartment is located right in the heart of the city or town</h2>



<p>Mall developers make sure that their business is always located in an area where a lot of people pass by and/or meet during the day. So, if your apartment is located right next to a huge shopping center, then you can be sure that your apartment is located right in the heart of the city. You are in the vicinity of the most vital parts of the city such as the main road, schools, and business districts.</p>

<p>Acquisition of personal Real Estate assets/Landed property in your name, indicating a welcome change from a life of paying rent and living in fear of the Landlord is what we term success.</p>



<p>But the Nigerian Real Estate sector is fraught with too many legal risks and is as a result, highly regulated.</p>



<p>That you made a payment to the Land vendor and signed a document called a Deed of Assignment which the âAgent of the sellerâ claims his lawyer prepared does not mean that you are good to go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is it over? How can you be completely sure that the owner of the land sold you a valid and free title to the property you paid for? How sure are you that your title has been registered and secured under the law just because you signed a Deed of Assignment?</p>



<p>We shall look into questions and responses concerning that.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can I be sure that the land vendor is genuine and that he is selling me a legitimate title?Â </h2>



<p>You can do your due diligence through this measure known as a SEARCH REPORT being carried out at the Land Registry of the state where the property you want to buy is located( the FCT Department of Lands Administration for Abuja or Federal Land Registry for Federal Land Registry for Federal Land owned in states e.g. FHA Real Estate assets).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the requirements and procedures for a Land Search Report?</h2>



<p>-Write an application letter to the Director of Lands Administration detailing the property information as it appears on the Certificate of Occupancy including the particulars of the supposed owner/vendor of the property, the plot and file numbers, the Certificate of Occupancy number, and date details</p>



<p>-Attach to this application evidence of payment (a customized teller) of a search fee of 10,000 Naira for a Residential purpose property or 20,000 Naira for Commercial purpose properties (which might have been increased). You will also need to present an original certificate or a right of occupancy for sighting and documentation purposes and a valid means of identification</p>



<p>-A search of the property will then be carried out by Land Registry staff.</p>



<p>Note: In addition to a Land Registry search, you will need to also carry out a corporate search at the Corporate Affairs Commission if the property is sold by a company, you also need to search with the State Probate Registry for a Letter of Administration or Probate Grant if the vendor says the property he is selling was gotten via inheritance. If the property is said to be gotten as part of a share of Community land, you need to properly verify this by checking with as many members of the extended family and community as possible.</p>



<p>If the property you wish to buy is developed or a high-rise building structure you might need to procure or ask the vendor for a profile of the building designers as well as a certificate of structural integrity as well as technical information on the building foundation quality.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What if the land I want to buy is not registered and has no title documentation attached to it?</h2>



<p>In the case of Lagos where this is more of a problem, you will have to carry out what is known as Charting at the State Surveyor-Generalâs office to check if the land is under Government acquisition or eligible for private ownership.</p>



<p>In some cases, the vendor might tell you that the landed property is covered by an excision (a release of land by the Governor of a state to a community or a set of Private occupiers using a Gazette) which might be a lie and can only be confirmed by a Gazette number.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does it mean if I go ahead and buy this piece of unregistered property and it turns out to be a government acquisition?</h2>



<p>That means you have been scammed.</p>



<p>Buying land of this nature is a gamble. If the land is a pure Government acquisition, you can simply carry out what is called Land Regularization/ Ramification which involves buying the same piece of land all over, but this time paying directly to the Government.</p>



<p>If the land however is what is called a government commitment acquisition, then your money is totally gone and you are definitely getting no land as Government-committed lands are usually earmarked for dedicated State projects from Government estates and schemes to Power distribution lines, Oil and Gas pipelines, Agricultural schemes, industrial layouts.</p>



<p>How can I do my due diligence without running the risk of losing this deal to quicker buyers? What can I do to commit with the vendor so I donât lose the juicy offer?</p>



<p>In that case, what you should do is to execute a Contract of Sale which legally binds both of you pending when you carry out your findings and finally complete the sale through a statutorily required Deed of Assignment or Conveyance. This contract will have the legal effect of invalidating any subsequent discreet sale to a purchaser for a higher value if attempted by the vendor.</p>



<p>Note: Such a Contract of Sale usually requires that you deposit a portion of the Transaction price of the piece of land. It is also prudent to demand that the vendor under the contract provide every help needed to register your title to the property after the Deed of Assignment has been completed and the Transaction value of the property has been fully paid by you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why do I need to register my title to the property? Wonât just completing the payment and signing the Deed of Assignment or Conveyance be enough to qualify as a complete transfer of property?</h2>



<p>By Section 22 of the Land Use Act 1978, it is a compulsory requirement that every transaction or conveyance of a Statutory Right of Occupancy be registered after getting the consent of the Governor of the State who by the Act is the Statutory Trustee/ Legal ownership repository of all lands within a state. Customary rights of Occupancy are regulated by the Local Government of the area where the land is situated.</p>



<p>What this means is that all Land transactions must be registered with the State Land Registry after getting a Governorâs consent, otherwise, they will be deemed illegal. So, you must commence the Registration process within 30 days of executing the Deed of Assignment.</p>



<p>What does it take to register a title to Real Estate property and how long does it take to obtain a Governorâs consent?</p>



<p>1. A completed application for a grant/subsequent grant of a Statutory Right of Occupancy</p>



<p>2. Proof of payment of an application processing fee of 100,000 Naira for commercial land and 50,000 Naira at designated banks</p>



<p>3. A photocopy of a receipt obtained from the Abuja Geographical Information System (AGIS) upon presentation of the application processing fee teller</p>



<p>4.2 passport photographs</p>



<p>5. A valid means of Identification</p>



<p>6. Tax Clearance Certificate</p>



<p>(For land that is to be acquired for Development/ Commercial purposes, the following will be required:</p>



<p>1. A schematic design of the proposed building</p>



<p>2. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)</p>



<p>3. Evidence of Financial and Technical capacity</p>



<p>4. Incorporation Certificate, CAC forms, and Corporate Tax Clearance Certificates in the case of the applicant being a company</p>



<p>Building permits in Abuja are handled by the Department of Development Control (DODC)</p>



<p>It should also be noted that the AGIS registers Powers of Attorney over undeveloped portions of land within Abuja while a Deed of Assignment is registered to indicate the conveyance of a title to a developed portion of land within Abuja.</p>
