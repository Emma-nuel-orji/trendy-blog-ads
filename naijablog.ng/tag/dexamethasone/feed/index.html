<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61075" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Dexamethasone-.jpg?resize=525%2C307&#038;ssl=1" alt="How dexamethasone is being used as weight gain drug by Nigerians" width="525" height="307"  data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Dexamethasone is a drug used in the management of severe COVID-19 infection.</p>
<p>Now, health care providers in Nigeria have warned members of the public to avoid the unethical use of the drug.</p>
<p>The drug is a type of corticosteroid medication that is used in the treatment of many conditions, including rheumatic problems, a number of skin diseases, severe allergies, asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, croup, brain swelling, eye pain following eye surgery, and along with antibiotics in tuberculosis management.</p>
<p>As a steroid, it comes with multiple side effects such as weight gain, when abused, according to medical experts.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation revealed in June that the drug was tested among patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in the United Kingdom’s national clinical trial recovery and was found to have benefits for critically ill patients.</p>
<p>WHO said,</p>
<p>“According to preliminary findings shared with WHO, for patients on ventilators, the treatment was shown to reduce mortality by about one third; and for patients requiring only oxygen, mortality was cut by about one fifth.”</p>
<p>The United Nations agency added,</p>
<p>“WHO is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include Dexamethasone or other steroids.”</p>
<p>The latest discovery in Nigeria is that dexamethasone is being abused by some Nigerians as a means to gain weight.</p>
<p>At a pharmacy in Lagos State, a drug attendant said that it is called ‘yodi’<br />
(buttocks enhancer) and ‘mawu mawu’ (weight enhancer) by those seeking to use it for weight gain purposes.</p>
<p>He revealed that the pharmacy does not dispense the drug without doctor’s prescription and stated that the drug is “popular among teenagers and young ladies who are desperate to gain weight.”</p>
