<p>The Senegalis born American singer, popular known as Akon has say he doesn&#8217;t do drugs nor smoke.</p>



<p>In circular that has gone viral on social media, Akon didn&#8217;t only says he doesn&#8217;t involved in drugs and smoking, but also praise himself as the only rapper in the whole music business that doesn&#8217;t smoke, drink, or do drugs.</p>



<p>Part of his words read:</p>



<p>&#8220;I get dizzy when someone smokes near me, like I just hate it. I once tried to wrap a blunt, but my dad snéâked behind me and whîppéd me so if I&#8217;m not smôkîng today, it&#8217;s all thanks to my dad, I decided to never smôké. Growing up, I was never pressed by péer pressure. You couldn&#8217;t make me do what I knew wasn&#8217;t right. It couldn&#8217;t just happen because I always sort to uphold all the morals my dad thought me.&#8221; Akon</p>



<p>Truth be told, a lot of people do funny things which they know are wrong just because they can&#8217;t resist péer pressure. Friends will tell you things like, &#8220;Grow up, one time won&#8217;t hurt,&#8221; and you&#8217;ll go ahead to do it knowing fully well that it isn&#8217;t right.</p>



<p>Many people have gone astray because they&#8217;re not living but existing and letting people decide their lives for them. In all you do, live a moral life because you aren&#8217;t here to impress people for everything you do. You shall bear the consequences alone</p>

<p>This was made known in a statement signed by the Director of Media and Advocacy, Femi Babafemi, shared on the agency’s page on Sunday.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="169" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824531954.jpg?resize=300%2C169&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-144362" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824531954.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824531954.jpg?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1 678w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824531954.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>The statement disclosed that the property was used as a clandestine laboratory for producing methamphetamine by a convicted drug baron, Okenwa Chris Nzewi.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824534461.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-144363" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824534461.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824534461.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>Following Nzewi&#8217;s conviction, the mansion, along with his vehicle marked EKY 496 DJ, has been forfeited to the Federal Government.</p>



<p>Nzewi, arrested with associate Sunny Okeh Ukah, had pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four and three years imprisonment, respectively.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824536932.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-144364" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824536932.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824536932.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>The statement in part said, “Okenwa was arrested along with his associate, Sunny Okeh Ukah on 30th July 2022 and subsequently arraigned on four counts in charge number FHC/L/527C/2022 at the Federal High Court, Lagos. They both pleaded guilty on 17th July 2023, while they were convicted and sentenced to four and three years imprisonment each with an option of fine of four million (N4,000,000) naira and three million (N3,000,000) naira respectively in addition to community service for four and three weeks each. His vehicle marked EKY 496 DJ was equally forfeited to the Federal Government.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824540273.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-144366" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824540273.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824540273.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>“To further deny him of enjoying the proceeds of his criminal activity, the NDLEA filed a civil forfeiture charge against the building used as a clandestine laboratory at the Federal High Court Lagos which initially granted an interim forfeiture order that elapsed on 6th December before the final forfeiture on 7th December 2023.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="169" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824543475.jpg?resize=300%2C169&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-144365" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824543475.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824543475.jpg?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1 678w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FB_IMG_1702824543475.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>“Meanwhile, NDLEA operatives in Lagos on Friday 15th December arrested a 75-year-old grandma, Mrs. Sekinat Soremekun for dealing in illicit drugs. At the time of her arrest in the Oshodi area of Lagos, quantities of cannabis and litres of codeine syrup were recovered from her. She claimed her son, Segun who is now at large supplied her the illicit substances which she retailed.”</p>

<p>Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) have seized 1.8tons (1,855 kilograms) of cocaine said to be worth more than $278,250,000 (over N194billion) in street value.</p>



<p>The illicit drugs, which appear to be the biggest singular seizure in the history of Nigeria’s premier anti-narcotic agency, were seized during a raid at a major warehouse located in Ikorodu area of Lagos on Sunday, September 18.</p>



<p>NDLEA’s spokesperson, Femi Babafemi, in a statement on Monday, September 19, said four drug barons and one other including a Jamaican and the warehouse manager were arrested in the well coordinated and intelligence led operation that lasted two days across different locations in Lagos state.</p>



<p>“Kingpins of the cocaine cartel in custody include: Messrs Soji Jibril, 69, an indigene of Ibadan, Oyo state; Emmanuel Chukwu, 65, who hails from Ekwulobia, Anambra state; Wasiu Akinade, 53, from Ibadan, Oyo state; Sunday Oguntelure, 53, from Okitipupa, Ondo state and Kelvin Smith, 42, a native of Kingston, Jamaica.</p>



<p>They are all members of an international drug syndicate that the Agency has been trailing since 2018.</p>



<p>The warehouse was raided on Sunday while the barons were picked from hotels and their hideouts in different parts of Lagos between Sunday night and Monday.</p>



<p>Preliminary investigation reveals the class A drugs were warehoused in the residential estate from where the cartel was trying to sell them to buyers in Europe, Asia and other parts of the world. They were stored in 10 travel bags and 13 drums,” the statement read.</p>

<p>Troops of 81 Division have foiled an attempt to smuggle Seven Hundred and Ninety-Two (792) parcels of illicit drugs suspected to be Cannabis Sativa (Marijuana) into Ogun State at a checkpoint along the Ilaro-Benin Republic Border following an intelligence-driven operation.</p>



<p>The parcels of Indian hemp were concealed in a truck coming from the Volta Region of Ghana. It was estimated that the suspected illicit drugs were worth about Ten Million Naira (#10,000,000.00) and were to be delivered to a drug syndicate based in Lagos that is presently on the run.</p>



<p>A search on the truck conveying the suspected consignment indicated that it was designed specifically to convey illicit drugs as there was a special compartment welded to the base of the truck for concealment purposes but could be discovered on scrutiny. It took the vigilance of the troops at the checkpoint to detect the concealed drugs after resisting the bribe offered by the suspected drug syndicates.</p>



<p>Accordingly, members of the public are enjoined to continue to provide useful information. On criminal activities to security agencies for a prompt response. The suspected illicit drugs and suspects have been handed over to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency Lagos Command for further action.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61075" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Dexamethasone-.jpg?resize=525%2C307&#038;ssl=1" alt="How dexamethasone is being used as weight gain drug by Nigerians" width="525" height="307"  data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Dexamethasone is a drug used in the management of severe COVID-19 infection.</p>
<p>Now, health care providers in Nigeria have warned members of the public to avoid the unethical use of the drug.</p>
<p>The drug is a type of corticosteroid medication that is used in the treatment of many conditions, including rheumatic problems, a number of skin diseases, severe allergies, asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, croup, brain swelling, eye pain following eye surgery, and along with antibiotics in tuberculosis management.</p>
<p>As a steroid, it comes with multiple side effects such as weight gain, when abused, according to medical experts.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation revealed in June that the drug was tested among patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in the United Kingdom’s national clinical trial recovery and was found to have benefits for critically ill patients.</p>
<p>WHO said,</p>
<p>“According to preliminary findings shared with WHO, for patients on ventilators, the treatment was shown to reduce mortality by about one third; and for patients requiring only oxygen, mortality was cut by about one fifth.”</p>
<p>The United Nations agency added,</p>
<p>“WHO is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include Dexamethasone or other steroids.”</p>
<p>The latest discovery in Nigeria is that dexamethasone is being abused by some Nigerians as a means to gain weight.</p>
<p>At a pharmacy in Lagos State, a drug attendant said that it is called ‘yodi’<br />
(buttocks enhancer) and ‘mawu mawu’ (weight enhancer) by those seeking to use it for weight gain purposes.</p>
<p>He revealed that the pharmacy does not dispense the drug without doctor’s prescription and stated that the drug is “popular among teenagers and young ladies who are desperate to gain weight.”</p>
