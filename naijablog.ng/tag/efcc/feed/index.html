<p>The Chairman of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ola Olukoyede, has called for legislation against unexplained wealth, as a way of checking the criminal activities of treasury looters in the country.</p>



<p>Speaking at a recent event in Ogun State, he said: ”The issue of unexplained wealth is not a local issue. There are jurisdictional legislations across the world to tackle it.</p>



<p>Till date, countries of the world are faced with criminalities emanating from money laundering practices and illicit funds. This circumstance led to the promulgation of Unexplained Wealth Orders, UWOs that came into force in 2018.</p>



<p>Several countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Mauritius and African countries like Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean have come up with UWO. Nigeria is yet to come up with a national legislation on it.</p>



<p>In Nigeria today, unexplained wealth has become practical means of tracing, identifying, investigating and prosecuting corr¥ption cases.</p>



<p>As an anti-graft agency, suspects of any economic and financial crimes are usually required to declare their assets in the course of investigation. The basis for this is to properly establish their true asset base and their linkage or otherwise to any act of corruption.</p>



<p>Owing to the absence of legislation on the issue of unexplained wealth, the EFCC continues to rely on provisions of Section 7 of its Establishment Act to handle it.</p>



<p>Nations are rapidly settling for non-conviction-based asset forfeiture. The reason for this is simple because unexplained wealth can only be beneficial to the state if they are forfeited</p>

<p>The Economic and Financial Crime Commission, EFCC, has arraigned Salisu Suleiman, managing director of Faris Construction Company Limited and his company on one-count charge of misappropriation of funds to the tune of N21,000,000 (Twenty One Million Naira) only.</p>



<p>He was arraigned on Tuesday, December 12, 2023 before Justice Hadiza Suleiman of the Kano State High Court sitting in Kano.</p>



<p>The lone count charge reads: “That you, Salisu Suleiman being the Managing Director of Faris Construction Company Limited and Faris Construction Company Limited on or about 15th June 2021 in Kano, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court dishonestly misappropriated the sum of N21,000,000 being payment for the supply of 125,000 litres of Automotive Gas Oil , AGO, to your construction site in Nguru Local Government, Yobe State by SID Oil and Gas Limited and you thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 308 of the Penal Code Law and punishable under Section 309 of the same law.”</p>



<p>He pleaded not guilty to the charge when it was read to him, prompting prosecution<br />counsel, Aisha Tahar Habib to pray the court for a trial date, while the defence counsel, Mardiyya Alasan Dawaki applied for his bail. Habib opposed the prayer of the defence counsel on the ground that the defendant had jumped<br />an administrative bail earlier granted him by the EFCC.</p>



<p>Justice Suleiman remanded the defendant in EFCC’s custody and adjourned for hearing on the bail application.</p>



<p>Suleiman allegedly received 125,000 litres of Automotive Gas Oil, diesel, on credit from the petitioner, S.I.D Oil and Gas Limited worth N21,000,000 (Twenty One Million Naira) on the ground that he will pay upon receipt of payment from Yobe State Government for the supply.</p>



<p>He, however, breached the promise after the Yobe State Government had paid him, preferring to lie to the defendant that he had received no payment from the state government. The petitioner suspected foul play and petitioned the EFCC. Investigations revealed that the defendant had been paid by the Yobe State Government a long time ago, but misappropriated and diverted the money entirely for his personal use.</p>

<p>The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, has patted himself on the back, claiming he helped to improve the value of the naira against the dollar.</p>



<p>“One achievement which most of you may not easily recognise is the impact which EFCC’s intervention in the forex market has had on the value of the naira,” Mr Bawa said at a workshop organised for journalists held at the anti-graft commission’s headquarters in Abuja, on Wednesday.</p>



<p>On July 29, Peoples Gazette reported how the EFCC raided Abuja bureau de change operators, claiming it was a bid to save the naira, which traded for N710 against the dollar in the black market then.</p>



<p>“From well over N710 to the dollar, following the commission’s intervention, the naira has appreciated significantly against the dollar in the parallel market,” Mr Bawa claimed. “And we are not relenting in our efforts to check harmful speculative activities in the sector.”</p>

<p>The trial of Azeez Fashola also known as Naira Marley continued today, July 15, 2022, before Justice I. Nicholas Oweibo of the Federal High Court sitting in Ikoyi, Lagos with a prosecuting witness, Dein Whyte, an operative of the EFCC continuing his evidence even as the court dismissed the defendant’s objection to the forensic evidence earlier presented by the witness.</p>



<p>Fashola is standing trial on an 11-count charge bordering on credit card fraud brought against him by the EFCC.</p>



<p>At the last sitting on June 9, 2022, the defence counsel, Olalekan Ojo SAN had objected to the witness&#8217;s opinion on the forensic evidence linking the defendant to credit card fraud. He had argued that only the court could make pronouncements on the defendant’s culpability, not an investigator.</p>



<p>At the resumed trial today, Justice Oweibo delivered a short ruling in which he dismissed the defence’s objection. “It is the duty of the law enforcement agency or Police, charging a person to court to investigate if the defendant committed the crime or not. The investigator must be able to link the defendant to the commission of the crime. The prosecutor must have made up his mind as to the involvement of the defendant before bringing the case to court. I do not agree that the prosecution has declared the defendant guilty”, the Judge ruled.</p>
