<p>Some youths on Sunday in Owerri, the Imo State capital protested the comment of a former governor, Emeka Ihedioha, tagging those who won&#8217;t vote the presidential candidate of the People&#8217;s Democratic, Atiku Abubakar, as saboteurs.</p>



<p>Ihedioha said this in a viral video from the New Yam festival of the Igbo community in Ghana last week. He has since apologised and said that his comments weren&#8217;t directed at Ndigbo.</p>



<p>However, the protesting youths under the aegis of Coalition for Peter Obi claimed that he insulted the sensitivity of the Igbo people.</p>

<p>Emeka Ihedioha in his statement to day says Anyone Who Votes for Peter Obi is Saboteur.</p>



<p>He said that now is Atiku Abubakar turned, After Atiku it Will Be Turn of Igbo.</p>



<p>Now if truly it a turn by turn as he said, After Buhari has spend his 8 years who supposed to come next?</p>



<p>The answer should be Igbos.</p>



<p>But Politics is dips and ones can imagine how Nigeria politicians has toy with lives of Nigerians because of there self gained.</p>



<p>Former Imo State Governor, who was unjustly removed by Court gained simpathy of Many Nigerians because of the act.</p>



<p>Many people believe that it shouldn&#8217;t has happened that way because we know those behind his removals did so just to gain power by all Means.</p>



<p>Today he isn&#8217;t in power, but what is expected of him was to be ambassador of good Governance of democracy in a nation.</p>



<p>But suddenly, he has forgotten, the quest for power has swept his main Sense of reasoning into the gutter.</p>



<p>Emeka Ihedioha today made flamboyant statement in regards to the People choices Presidential candidates for 2023 general elections, the person of Peter Obi.</p>



<p>His statement didn&#8217;t directly called his name, but uttering such words is clear indications that he speaks with Peter Obi.</p>



<p>If clear definition of Saboteur is to be maintained, Emeka is the real Saboteur not Peter Obi.</p>



<p>He didn&#8217;t only betrays  his own People, but betray young&#8217;s Nigerians that has tired of the old politicians who keep rulling us the same way with the same results.</p>

<p>A trending video has shown the former deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Emeka Ihedioha, saying that Nigeria’s presidency will rotate to the South-East, after the administration of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, if he wins next year’s election.<br><br>Ihedioha in this video said that Nigeria cannot afford to make mistakes in the 2023 election and that there are two parties in the election, the PDP and the All Progressives Congress.</p>



<p>He said, “Let me tell you, after Atiku Abubakar, the next president of Nigeria will come from the South-East of Nigeria. That is the gospel in Accra. You must win in Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi, Gombe, Borno, Yobe, Adamawa etc to become the president of Nigeria.</p>



<p>“There is what we call passion and there’s what we call emotion. They are two different things for people who went to school like me. Emotions don’t win elections. You must be realistic to win elections. You must plan to win election and that is where I belong. I want to tell you, I have the key to the direction of where Ibo should go.”</p>

<p>Dear Rt. Hon. Emeka Ihedioha,</p>



<p>At 56, you have definitely come a long way in your politics, your education, your training and in everything you have put your mind to.</p>



<p>Over the years, you have definitely made some mistakes, scored some high points, won some big deals, and if we must be truthful to ourselves without considering political correctness, you have truly achieved so much for your age, politically and otherwise. You are an inspiration to the younger generation.</p>



<p>While I may not agree with all your styles, especially, your policies during your brief stint as governor, I must acknowledge that you left your own mark. And I especially admire your comportment, public temperament and carriage. However, you remain one of Nigeria&#8217;s most dreaded democratic coupists <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.</p>



<p>A very fulfilling 56th birth anniversary to you Sir. Stay in good health and keep conspiring, but, in the best interest of the majority.</p>



<p>By Jones </p>

<p>Emeka Ihedioha, in the spirit of celebrating the international women days, recall the change brought to world by the Aba women Revolution.</p>



<p>Emeka Ihedioha wrote &#8220;Our Dear Women, your contributions have been legendary. Your sacrifices resonate in the family, community, State and the nation in general. Right from the colonial days, our women have always stood in the gap. When it was time to resist oppression, you were not found wanting.</p>



<p>You confronted the colonial masters in the now famous Aba Women Revolution. Indeed, a revolution it was, because it brought change and stopped the move by the colonial masters to tax our women.</p>



<p>Up until today, whether as Umuada, Aladinma or other community and professional women groups, you have been watchdogs, pillars of support, and strong forces for community good. You are the hands that rock the cradle, which rules the world.</p>



<p>Happy International Women’s Day.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">ChooseToChallenge&#8221;</h1>



<p>Emeka Ihedioha was a former and immediate governor of Imo State, sacked by supreme court, and installed Hope Uzodinma.</p>



<p>According to many Nigerians and International body, the judge is one of the most controversial judge in the history of Nigeria.</p>

<p>Former US legislator, John Lewis in dead.</p>



<p>Lewis died on 18tj of July 2020 at the age of 80 years.</p>



<p>In a reaction to his death, Former Governor of Imo State, Emeke Ihedioha, took to his Facebook page to say:</p>



<p>&#8220;Sad to hear about the passing of US legislator John Lewis. He was a veteran civil rights activist, a living legend and a quintessiantial congressman. It’s no wonder he was re-elected to 17 terms by his constituents.</p>



<p>With my history as a parliamentarian, and indeed an advocate for quality multiple-term representation, I admired him a great deal, albeit from a continental distance. It was a great pleasure to have met him last year during the Conference of the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington D.C. commemorating the 400th anniversary of the beginning of institutionalised slavery in America.</p>



<p>John Lewis will be remembered for many things, especially his advocacy for equal rights and justice. The world has lost a veritable political role model whose legacy and impact will live on. Rest In Peace Rep John Lewis.&#8221;</p>

<p>Former Imo State Governor Emeka Ihedioha has asked an Owerri High Court to stop the House of Assembly from probing him for allegedly mismanaging N19.63 billion council funds.<br />The state Auditor-General for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs had issued an interim audit report detailing how N19.63 billion fraudulently disappeared from the Local Government accounts between May and December 31, 2019.</p>



<p>Apparently worried that the House of Assembly may probe the allegation, Ihedioha applied for a perpetual injunction restraining it from investigating him.<br />In May 5 suit filed at the Owerri Judicial Division, the former Governor, through an origination summons, is seeking an order of perpetual injunction restraining the House of Assembly from inviting him for an investigation into the alleged missing funds.<br />Imo State House of Assembly, the Speaker and Clerk are the defendants.<br />The suit is also seeking an order to set aside any summon or invitation to Ihedioha, by the House or its agents, to appear before it for probe.<br />Two days after the originating summons was filed, Ihedioha’s lawyer, S.A Anyalewechi, dispatched a letter to the Speaker, asking him to restrain the House and its agents from inviting his client for an investigation.<br />Imo State government had on April 14 approved a request by the Auditor-General for Local Governments and Chieftaincy Affairs to recover N19.63billion allegedly misappropriated by the Ihedioha administration.</p>



<p>The money was allegedly taken from the State-Local Government Joint Accounts Allocation Committee (JAAC) through the Bureau for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs (BLGCA).</p>



<p>Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, said in a statement that the sum was discovered during a routine audit of the accounts and records of JAAC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.</p>



<p>He said the government’s action was in line with the New Imo Agenda of transparency in public service and financial discipline.</p>



<p>According to the Commissioner, the money was illegally withdrawn from JAAC account without any Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), Stores Receipt Vouchers (SRV) or Stores Issue Vouchers (SIV).</p>



<p>He alleged that the Ihedioha administration paid a “crony” N1.215 billion for unsupplied construction equipment without any document.</p>



<p>“There was also an unconscionable mandatory withdrawal of N2.405illion by the Bureau for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs (BLGCA).</p>



<p>“Others are payment of N9.378billion to Local Government councils for an undisclosed purpose.”</p>



<p>Emelumba said a firm received N245 million for no disclosed purpose.</p>



<p>“Other fictitious and fraudulent withdrawals include compulsory returns or kickbacks from Local Government Councils to the BLGCA to the tune of N2.404billion.</p>



<p>“This was deducted from the allocated funds of the LGAs,” he said, among others.</p>
