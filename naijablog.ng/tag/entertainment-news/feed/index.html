<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-71669" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Uti-.jpg?resize=198%2C372&#038;ssl=1" alt="Uti Nwachukwu begs Tacha for forgiveness" width="198" height="372" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Uti Nwachukwu has appealed to former BBNaija Season 4 housemate, Tacha to let bygones be bygones.⁣<br />
⁣<br />
He has apologised to reality TV star, Natasha Akhide for the comments he made about her after she was disqualified from the fourth season of reality TV show, Big Brother Naija.⁣</p>
<p>In a lengthy post shared via his Instagram page on Tuesday, September 8, 2020, Uti was remorseful as he recounted all that transpired after Tacha&#8217;s disqualification.⁣</p>
<p>He wrote,<br />
⁣<br />
&#8220;You will never understand till it happens to you” &#8211; popular saying I will never be too proud to acknowledge my personal epiphanies and when it’s time to actually obey ur conscience which I always say is your spirit.<br />
⁣<br />
Call it karma call it a wake-up call. But you always have to listen to that voice inside Recent events have triggered memories from last year’s #bbnaija When another housemate was disqualified. Let’s just say, now I know how it feels for her and her fans.<br />
⁣<br />
Most importantly, I am deeply regretful for the harsh words I tweeted when I felt provoked by her passionate FANS who were upset.</p>
<p>It was not fair to her as she had PERSONALLY not done anything to ME. My reactions to the insults were wrong and not inspired from a place of Love which I always champion&#8221;<br />
⁣<br />
How others treat us is no fault of ours. But how we respond/ REACT is fully up to us. An eye for an eye leaves the world Blind (I’m still learning this one sha cos sometimes the spirit of Gbas gbos is tooo strong lol).<br />
⁣<br />
I’m also someone that says, don’t insult me in public and then come and apologise privately. So symply_tacha I am extremely sorry for the mean tweets I responded with last year. Please accept my deepest apologies&#8221;⁣<br />
⁣<br />
He appealed to Tacha to extend an olive branch and let bygones be bygones.</p>
