										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We’ve helped more than a billion people connect with loved ones in a trusted space on Messenger, and we know that people want to engage in real time with larger communities over shared interests. Today,<a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/pfbid023w43bp4o5EHhDzfya42n6P8HPTk21J8uokbUsASVvYhD6M81PbUUZpCLQWhqRokLl"> Mark Zuckerberg announced</a> we’ll begin testing the ability for people to start Community Chats in Messenger in the coming weeks, allowing people to create a Facebook Group, start chats and audio channels, and invite others to join their new group all within the app. We’ll also be expanding Community Chats to even more Facebook Groups.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screenshot_20220916-102907-373x630.jpg?resize=373%2C630&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-124745" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Community Chats?</h2>



<p>Community Chats let people connect more deeply with communities in real time around the topics they care about in multiple formats, including text, audio and video. The experience seamlessly blends Messenger and Facebook Groups to allow people to connect when, where and how they want. Admins can now start a conversation about a topic and get in-the-moment responses instead of waiting for people to comment on a post. And, rather than navigating multiple topics in a single Messenger group chat, the person who creates the Community Chat can organize chats into categories so group members can easily find what’s most interesting to them. For example, a band’s fan group could have a “Breaking News” category with chats dedicated to new album drops, tour dates and group activities.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screenshot_20220916-102917-650x630.jpg?resize=650%2C630&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-124746" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How It Works</h2>



<p>Check out how Vanessa Yaeger, admin of the <a href="https://web.facebook.com/groups/660162784037641/?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr">Women Who Surf </a>Facebook Group, uses Community Chats to bring her members together in real time for a spontaneous IRL meetup.</p>



<p>Admins can choose from several options to help their communities connect. They can start a chat for group members around a specific topic, an event chat for an outing or meetup, a view-only broadcast chat for admins to announce group-wide updates and an admin-only chat to collaborate with admins and moderators. Admins can also create audio channels so group members can share live commentary or receive real-time support. Participants also have the option to enable video once they’re in the audio channel. For example, the admin of a Facebook Group for chemistry students could create audio channels for study groups during finals season, and participants can turn on video for live tutoring. Community Chats are only accessible to members of a group. To learn more about how to use Community Chats, check out the <a href="https://web.facebook.com/community/whats-new/using-community-chats-in-your-group/?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr">Facebook Community Blog</a>.<br /></p>



<p>Given the more public nature of Community Chats, we’ve developed a robust suite of tools to help admins easily manage both chat and audio experiences. This includes moderation capabilities like blocking, muting or suspending group members, and removing members or messages, as well as Admin Assist, which allows admins to set custom criteria that will automatically suspend users, remove reported messages, and stop messages from ineligible authors or containing violating content from being sent. Members of Community Chats can also report messages to group admins or Meta, block users or leave a chat at any time.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s Next</h2>



<p>We’re committed to building messaging experiences that help people connect with their communities, friends and families. As Community Chats rolls out to more people and groups around the world, we’ll continue exploring new features and capabilities to make it easier to connect with one another.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, Meta announced that it has built and open sourced ‘No Language Left Behind’&nbsp;<a href="https://ai.facebook.com/research/no-language-left-behind/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NLLB-200</a>, a single AI model that is the first to translate across 200 different languages, including 55 African languages with state-of-the-art results. Meta is using the modelling techniques and learnings from the project to improve and extend translations on Facebook, Instagram, and Wikipedia.</p>



<p>In an&nbsp;<a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/teaching-ai-to-translate-100s-of-spoken-and-written-languages-in-real-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">effort to develop high-quality machine translation capabilities for most of the world’s low-resource languages</a>, this single AI model was designed with a focus on African languages. They are challenging from a machine translation perspective. AI models require lots and lots of data to help them learn, and there&#8217;s not a lot of human translated training data for these languages. For example, there’s more than 20M people who speak and write in Luganda but examples of this written language are extremely difficult to find on the internet.</p>



<p>We worked with professional translators for each of these languages to develop a reliable benchmark which can automatically assess translation quality for many low-resource languages. We also work with professional translators to do human evaluation too, meaning people who speak the languages natively evaluate what the AI produced. The reality is that a handful of languages dominate the web, so only a fraction of the world can access content and contribute to the web in their own language. We want to change this by creating more inclusive machine translations systems – ones that unlock access to the web for the more than 4B people around the world that are currently excluded because they do not speak one of the few languages content is available in.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s impressive how much AI is improving all of our services. We just open-sourced an AI model we built that can translate across 200 different languages &#8212; many of which aren&#8217;t supported by current translation systems. We call this project No Language Left Behind, and the AI modelling techniques we used are helping make high quality translations for languages spoken by billions of people around the world. To give a sense of the scale, the 200-language model has over 50 billion parameters, and we trained it using our new Research SuperCluster, which is one of the world’s fastest AI supercomputers. The advances here will enable more than 25 billion translations every day across our apps. Communicating across languages is one superpower that AI provides, but as we keep advancing our AI work it&#8217;s improving everything we do &#8212; from showing the most interesting content on Facebook and Instagram, to recommending more relevant ads, to keeping our services safe for everyone.</p>



<p>,” said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a post on his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook profile</a>.</p>



<p>Language is our culture, identity, and lifeline to the world. However, as high-quality translation tools don’t exist for hundreds of languages, billions of people today can&#8217;t access digital content or participate fully in conversations and communities online in their preferred or native languages. This is especially true for hundreds of millions of people who speak the many languages of Africa.</p>



<p>“Africa is a continent with very high linguistic diversity, and language barriers exist day to day. We are pleased to announce that 55 African languages will be included in this machine translation research, making it a major breakthrough for our continent,” Balkissa Ide Siddo, Public Policy Director for Africa said while speaking about the launch of the AI model. “In the future, imagine visiting your favourite Facebook group, coming across a post in Igbo or Luganda, and being able to understand it in your own language with just a click of a button – that’s where we hope research like this leads us. Highly accurate translations in more languages could also help to spot harmful content and misinformation, protect election integrity, and curb instances of online sexual exploitation and human trafficking.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While commenting on accessibility and inclusion in the pursuit of building an equitable metaverse, Ide Siddo added “At Meta, we are working today to ensure that as many people as possible will be able to access the new educational, social and economic opportunities that the next evolution of the internet will bring to future technology and an everyday living experience tomorrow.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To confirm that the translations are high quality, Meta also created a new evaluation dataset,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/flores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FLORES-200</a>, and measured NLLB-200’s performance in each language. Results revealed that NLLB-200 exceeds the previous state of the art by an average of 44 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meta is also open-sourcing the NLLB-200 model and publishing a slew of research tools to enable other researchers to extend this work to more languages and build more inclusive technologies. Meta AI is also providing up to $200,000 of grants to non-profit organizations for real world applications for NLLB-200.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are versions of Wikipedia in more than 300 languages, but most have far fewer articles than the 6+ million available in English. Following Meta’s partnership with the&nbsp;<a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikimedia Foundation</a>, the non-profit organization that hosts Wikipedia and other free knowledge projects, modelling&nbsp; techniques and learnings from the NLLB research are now also being applied to translation systems used by Wikipedia editors. Using the&nbsp;Wikimedia Foundation’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Content_translation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Content Translation Tool</a>, articles can now be easily translated in more than 20 low-resource languages (those that don’t have extensive datasets to train AI systems), including 10 that previously were not supported by any machine translation tools on the platform.</p>



<p>To explore a demo of NLLB-200 showing how the model can translate stories from around the world, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://nllb.metademolab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.

<p><br>Lagos, Nigeria &#8211; June 20, 2022: Meta has officially launched the Meta Non-profit training program, a digital capacity building program for 1,500 non-profit personnel across Anglophone West Africa. <br>At the event which took place in Lagos recently, Meta also announced its support for Geda Digital training, a six month Social Innovators Bootcamp Program for Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). These trainings are aimed at supporting the non-profit and social impact sector across Anglophone West Africa. </p>



<p><br>“We know the value of digital skills and Meta is committed to helping non-profits and social enterprises across Nigeria acquire these skills by providing them with information that will increase their overall digital awareness” Adaora Ikenze, Head of Public Policy for Anglophone West Africa said while giving opening address during the launch event. “We recognise the needs of these NGOs and we are excited to partner with NGOs who leverage our family of apps for impact. We are delighted to provide the required support in upskilling them to scale and strengthen the work they do within their communities”.<br>While giving the keynote address, Maryam Uwais, Special Advisor to President Muhammadu Buhari on Social Investments, said, “We commend the initiatives of Meta towards developing people working in the non-profit sector. This investment is deeply appreciated by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Meta has continuously been a partner to the government, we must continue with this partnership to make Nigeria a better place”.</p>



<p><br>During a fireside chat at the event, Adeyemi Adenike, Chief Executive Officer, FATE Foundation stressed the need for NGOs to identify cost effective methods of reaching their target audience and sharing their impact stories, especially by leveraging Meta family of apps during the chat. Buttressing this, Chidi Koldsweat, Founder/CEO, Donors for Africa Foundation, stated that the collaboration with Meta on the Geda Digital Training will be helpful in providing visibility for NGOs.<br>To further underscore Meta’s longstanding approach to connecting with more allies and supporting NGOs that are using Meta’s family of Apps for good, Meta held a series of engagements with the social impact sector in 2021, including listening sessions and training for non-profit organisations. Meta also held pilot sessions of its Meta Non-Profit program with partners in Tanzania, Nigeria and South Africa.</p>



<p><br>Applications for the Geda Digital Bootcamp and Meta Non-profit training are now open. NGOs and non-profits organisations can indicate interest for Meta Nonprofit training <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nnngo.org/meta-nonprofit-training-program/" target="_blank">here</a> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nnngo.org/meta-nonprofit-training-program/" target="_blank">https://nnngo.org/meta-nonprofit-training-program/</a>) and for Geda Digital Bootcamp <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://dfageda.org/2022-applications/" target="_blank">here</a> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://dfageda.org/2022-applications/" target="_blank">http://dfageda.org/2022-applications/</a> ).</p>

<p>23 May 2022 – As part of its Africa Day celebrations on 25 May, Meta today announced the return of its global campaign&nbsp;<strong><em>‘Made by Africa, Loved by the World’</em></strong>, which was first launched in 2021. Aimed at amplifying the voices and stories of people and businesses from across Africa that are impacting the world, this year’s campaign spotlights eight creators, innovators and SMBs who are making a name for themselves not only in Africa, but globally, and are changing the way Africa is viewed on the international stage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/generic_a_d_1_1_dark1248681849234442471-scaled.jpg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-111912" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>As part of the on-platform and marketing campaign, Meta has partnered with local filmmakers to bring to life eight phenomenal stories. Alongside this will run a dedicated global and local Instagram campaign featuring partnerships with African content creators, a community Reels challenge, the development of a specially designed AR filter inspired by #AfricaMade, as well as a&nbsp;series of free open virtual training sessions via the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetaAfrica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meta Africa page</a>, dedicated to all SMBs and Creators from across Africa.</p>



<p>Speaking about the campaign, Kezia Anim-Addo, Communications Director, Sub-Saharan Africa, said, “I’m truly excited to be bringing back&nbsp;<em>‘Made by Africa, Loved by the World’</em>&nbsp;for the 2nd year running. This campaign is about showcasing the incredible talent we have here on the continent, and the African people and businesses that are not only contributing to the global agenda, but are forging their own paths.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong> </strong> Meta is expanding the availability of  <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/launching-reels-on-facebook-us/" target="_blank">Facebook Reels</a> for iOS and Android to more than 20 countries across sub-Saharan Africa. Meta is also introducing better ways to help creators to earn money, new creation tools and more places to watch and create Facebook Reels.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prior to this launch Reels was available on Facebook in India, Mexico, Canada, the U.S, and is now available across sub-Saharan Africa in: Zimbabwe, Zambia, Uganda, Tanzania, Swaziland, South Africa, Seychelles, Senegal, Rwanda, Nigeria, Namibia, Mali, Malawi, Lesotho, Kenya, Guinea, Ghana, Cape Verde, Cameroon, Burkina Faso.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commenting on the launch Nunu Ntshingila, Regional Director for sub-Saharan Africa at Meta says, “We’ve seen that video now accounts for almost all of the time people spend on Facebook and Instagram, and Reels is our fastest growing content format by far. This is why we’re focused on making Reels the best way for creators to get discovered, connect with their audience and earn money. We also want to make it fun and easy for people to find and share relevant and entertaining content.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://mobile-webview.gmail.com/-1134379127/blocked" alt="Facebook Reels Experience_de_DE.png"/></figure>



<p>Meta is also creating a variety of opportunities for creators to earn money for their reels. The<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/launching-reels-on-facebook-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/launching-reels-on-facebook-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reels Play bonus program</a>, part of Meta’s<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/investing-1-billion-dollars-in-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/investing-1-billion-dollars-in-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1 billion creator investment</a>, pays eligible creators up to $35,000 a month based on the views of their qualifying reels. In the coming months, the bonus program will be extended to more countries, so more creators can get rewarded for creating reels that their communities love.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the launch Meta is also launching brand suitability controls, including Publisher Lists, Blocklists, Inventory Filters and Delivery Reports for Banner and Sticker Ads in Facebook Reels in every region they are available, giving advertisers more control over how their ads appear in places they don&#8217;t consider suitable for their brand or campaign. Additionally, Meta has been testing full-screen and immersive ads in between Facebook Reels since October of last year, and will roll them out to more places around the world over the coming months. Just like with organic content on Facebook, people can comment, like, view, save, share and skip them.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>More Editing Features</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/launching-reels-on-facebook-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/launching-reels-on-facebook-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features</a>&nbsp;announced last year, creators around the world will be able to access:</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Remix:</strong>&nbsp;Create your own reel alongside an existing, publicly-shared reel on Facebook. When you create a Remix, you can create a reel that includes all or part of another creator’s reel.</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>60-second Reels:</strong>&nbsp;Make reels up to 60 seconds long.</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Drafts:&nbsp;</strong>You will soon be able to create a reel and choose to “Save As Draft” below the Save button.</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Video Clipping:</strong>&nbsp;In the coming months, we’re planning to roll out video clipping tools that will make it easier for creators who publish live or long-form, recorded videos to test different formats.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Create and Discover Reels in New Places</strong></p>



<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Over the coming weeks, the following updates will be rolled out to make it easier to create and discover reels in new places:</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Reels in Stories:&nbsp;</strong>You can share public reels to Stories on Facebook, making it easy to share favourite reels with friends and giving creators more visibility and reach. You’ll also be able to create reels from existing public stories.</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Reels in Watch:&nbsp;</strong>You’ll be able to watch reels directly within the Watch tab and we’re developing tools to help you create reels in the Watch tab as well.</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Top of Feed:&nbsp;</strong>We’re addinga new Reels label at the top of Feed so you’ll be able to easily create and watch reels in just a few clicks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Suggested Reels in Feed:</strong>&nbsp;In select countries, we’re starting to suggest reels that you may like in your Feed from people you do not already follow.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meta is also exploring ways to make it easier for creators to share Reels to both their Facebook and Instagram audiences, such as cross posting.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find Facebook Reels in Feed, Groups and Watch. When viewing a reel, you can follow the creator directly from the video, like and comment on it or share it with friends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> Meta today released its ‘2021 Africa Year in Review’, an infographic capturing some of the company&#8217;s significant investments and initiatives in sub-Saharan Africa this year &#8211; focused on driving innovation, connecting communities, helping businesses to grow and supporting the tech and creator ecosystem. The infographic highlights key Meta successes and milestones across the region, whilst reinforcing its continued commitment to Africa.</p>



<p>Commenting, Kezia Anim-Addo, Director for Communications, Sub-Saharan Africa, said: “This year we’ve witnessed an abundance of talent, growth and resilience from across Africa, despite the many challenges due to the ongoing COVID pandemic. It&#8217;s been inspiring to witness the development of various communities,&nbsp; from creators to SMBs and tech innovators, many of whom are using Meta technologies to grow and develop their craft. We believe that Meta sits at the intersection of innovation, technology, entrepreneurship and social connection, and we’re excited about the future of the continent, and Meta’s ongoing role in helping to unlock Africa&#8217;s potential.”</p>



<p>Some of the key&nbsp;<em>2021 Meta Africa Year in Review includes</em>:</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Facebook Marketplace:&nbsp;</strong>Rolled out Facebook Marketplace to 37 countries and territories across Sub-Saharan Africa, enabling more people to discover, buy and sell items from others in their local communities</p>

<p><strong>09 November 2021</strong> &#8211; Today, Meta announced the launch of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=27600670000&#038;text=Hi&#038;app_absent=0" target="_blank">Facebook Business Coach</a>, an innovative and easily-accessible way for owners of small-and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya and other English speaking countries to learn more about how to grow their business online with Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=27600670000&amp;text=Hi&amp;app_absent=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook Business Coach</a>&nbsp;available on WhatsApp, is a free-to-use, low data cost educational chatbot tool that users can interact with in a simple, conversational and convenient way. SMBs have access to automated, self-paced lessons that teach them how to establish a presence in today’s ever-evolving digital economy.</p>



<p>As a free curriculum platform, it features step-by-step courses and tutorials as well as helpful infographics, videos, and audio clips. Learning material is recommended based on the user’s needs and queries, with an option to navigate the curriculum via the menu. While the WhatsApp bot provides SMBs with an easy way to quickly learn the basics, users can also access more in-depth&nbsp; training and get officially certified with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebookblueprint.com/student/catalog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meta Blueprint</a>&nbsp;courses online.</p>



<p>The content was created to assist business owners with multiple queries –&nbsp;from how to create attention-grabbing business pages on Facebook and Instagram, to how to use Messenger and WhatsApp to communicate effectively with clients.</p>



<p>Nunu Ntshingila, Regional Director Meta Africa, commented:&nbsp;<em>“In today’s social-media-driven environment, information on building your brand on online platforms can be crucial in what sets a small business apart and drives success. At Meta, we’re passionate about empowering SMBs in Africa with the skills they need to succeed online. We know that they are the backbone of the African economy and the drivers for economic growth.

<p>Founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook, now Known as Metaverse will give rooms for all creators to earns more money with it platform.</p>



<p>Zuckerberg disclose this few minutes ago in a post made available on his Official Facebook page.</p>



<p>He said promotional link for creators for their Subscriptions offering is currently on the way, and when the promotional links finally launch, all people that subscribe using this link, the creators will keep all the money they earn exclude  taxes.</p>



<p>Zuckerberg said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>As we build for the metaverse, we&#8217;re focused on unlocking opportunities for creators to make money from their work. The 30% fees that Apple takes on transactions make it harder to do that, so we&#8217;re updating our Subscriptions product so now creators can earn more. More details in the comments below </p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>1: We&#8217;re launching a promotional link for creators for their Subscriptions offering. When people subscribe using this link, creators will keep all the money they earn (minus taxes).</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>2: Creators will have more ownership of their audience &#8212; we&#8217;re giving the ability for them to download the email addresses of all of their new subscribers.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>3: We’re launching a bonus program that pays creators for each new subscriber they get as part of our $1 billion creator investment announced this summer. More to come.</p></blockquote>

<p>The #NoFalseNewsZone comic book was created by Facebook to help people think critically about the messages they come across online; helping them identify false news and the actions they can take to help minimise its spread.</p>



<p>The three-part comic book features relatable Nigerian characters who go on their personal journey to educate people on how to curb false news and also join the fight against misinformation to help create a #NoFalseNewsZone online.</p>



<p><em>Here are 5 things we learned from reading the #NoFalseNewsZone comic book.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>1) Don’t Believe Everything You See Online</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://mobile-webview.gmail.com/-1134379127/blocked" alt="main comic book cover..jpg"/></figure>



<p>You must realize that just because a viral story is presented as fact does not mean that it is. People wildly exaggerate story elements, and occasionally just straight-up lie for various motives, like Kehinde Lawal, who posted a video falsely accusing Teju of theft in order to gain public attention. It pays to have good friends like Chidi that will go out of their way to save the day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>2) False news can lead to real-world harm</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://mobile-webview.gmail.com/-1134379127/blocked" alt="Chidi (2).jpg"/></figure>



<p>Spreading false news can cause real-world problems for many people. Like we saw with Mariam&#8217;s husband who nearly lost his life from self-medication due to misinformation he found online, Teju being arrested due to a false video post, or Anita’s reputation being called into question by online trolls because she was falsely accused of encouraging property destruction. It is important to think critically about what we consume and create online to avoid causing real-world harm.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>3)&nbsp; Always&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zikoko.com/life/6-ways-to-easily-identify-false-news-online-and-how-to-report-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirm the authenticity</a>&nbsp;of news before sharing.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://mobile-webview.gmail.com/-1134379127/blocked" alt="Anita’s split-face.jpg"/></figure>



<p>It pays to be thorough. Before sharing any news story online, be sure it is true. We enjoyed reading how the reporters from Revolve News processed the information they had and how they took their time to confirm and share verified information. So before you repost or share any news story, be absolutely sure it’s legit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>4) Be your brother’s keeper.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://mobile-webview.gmail.com/-1134379127/blocked" alt="Revolve news.jpg"/></figure>



<p>The truth is that most people who share false news do not know it’s false before they share it. Take for instance, Faith was convinced she was doing the right thing by sending the information she had received from someone else. She never stopped to do her research and confirm if it’s true or false. Let’s be honest, we’ve all been in Faith’s shoes at one point or another. Thankfully, Nurse Mariam was not shy to share her husband’s experience with her. Talk about how to save a life! All it takes is one person to care. It starts with you!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>5) Don’t stay silent. If you spot false news, report it.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://mobile-webview.gmail.com/-1134379127/blocked" alt="Marian helping Faith.jpg"/></figure>



<p>If you’ve done your research about a news story and you’ve found it to be false, don’t share it. Report it to Facebook. Just like Anita explained at the end of her video, go to the top of the post and click the three dots. Select the&nbsp;<em>‘report post’</em>&nbsp;option, click&nbsp;<em>‘False Information’,&nbsp;</em>click ‘<em>Next</em>, and click&nbsp;<em>‘Done’.</em></p>
