										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Government on Monday, September 5, 2022, announced the suspension of the proposed 5 per cent Excise Duty on telecommunications services, and inaugurated a committee chaired by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, to review the policy, immediately.</p>



<p>Pantami, who inaugurated the Committee, which he chairs on the directive of President Muhammadu Buhari, with the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr. Zainab Ahmed as member, said the decision on the suspended policy will be made after the committee completes its report.</p>



<p>He recalled that the suspension directed by Mr. President, followed his petition as the Chairman of the Presidential Council on Digital Economy and eGovernment, as the policy has the potentials to impact very negatively on the digital economy sector, and particularly, telecommunications, which is already overburdened with a plethora of taxes totalling about 41 categories. He said some of these are multiple taxations because other tiers or levels of government were imposing same levies that MNOs had already paid to the Federal Government.</p>



<p>“Excessive taxation has been a central challenge of the Information and Communications Technology sector”, he said, arguing that it is unfair to overburden such a sector that is so central to the nation’s growth and development and especially because the sector rarely receives subsidy which other sectors have enjoyed.<br />“Despite the spiralling inflation, and cost of production, particularly the energy factor, the network service providers have not increased prices of services. I challenge the Gentlemen of the press here to name one sector that has not witnessed price increases in services in the last three years. It is only in telecoms that prices have been stable”, he said.</p>



<p>Other members of the committee inaugurated by Pantami, include the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (EVC/CEO) of Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Danbatta; the Executive Chairman of Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Mr. Muhammad Nami; and the representatives of Mobile Network Operators (MNOs).<br />Pantami recalled several positive developments in the sector that needs to be sustained through support of the government.</p>



<p>“Three unprecedented positive developments have occurred in the digital economy sector in the last three years. In the last quarter of 2020, ICT alone, without including digital services, contributed 14.70 per cent to the GDP. In the second quarter of 2021, we saw another record where the sector contributed 17.90 per cent to the GDP. The last record was in the second quarter of 2022 where ICT contributed 18.44 per cent to GDP. By implication, this sector has been contributing a lot to the economy,”, he said.</p>



<p>The Minister also reminded that “the 5G Spectrum Auction conducted by the NCC in December 2021, contributed $547 million. This is in addition to billions of naira in spectrum and other fees remitted to the Federal Government’s coffers by the Commission.”<br />Executive Vice Chairman of the NCC, Prof Danbatta, in his remarks, commended the Minister for the leadership and direction for the industry.</p>



<p>“The Minister has been leading from the front, including this effort to ensure this meeting takes place. Accordingly, we will do our best to get the best out of this assignment to the benefit of Nigerian citizens.”</p>

<p>Fresh facts have emerged on why the Academic Staff Union of Universities rejected the proposal by the Federal Government.</p>



<p>The PUNCH had earlier reported that ASUU had tagged the offer by the Federal Government as “miserable”. However, the union did not go into some of the details in the proposal.</p>



<p>But the zonal coordinator, Port Harcourt zone, Stanley Ogoun, in a statement made available to The PUNCH noted that the Federal Government noted that it would increase the salaries of professors by N60,000 while other lecturers would have their salaries increased within the range of N30,000 and N60,000.</p>



<p>Ogoun also noted that the government promised to release the revitalisation fund of N170 billion which would be included in the 2023 budget.</p>



<p>“Nigerians should be aware of offers the so-called minister came up with. These are: (a) 170 billion naira for revitalisation in the 2023 budget; (b) a promise to increase by N60,000 the salary of a professor at the bar in next year’s budget; (c) no statement on the amendment of the National University Commission Act gathering dust at the National Assembly (d) payment of two tranches of outstanding Earned Academic Allowance in next year’s budget; (d) a promise to adopt the University Transparency and Accountability Solution; and (e) another promise to release the white papers.”</p>



<p>Speaking further in the statement, Ogoun said, “Imagine the level of deceitfulness by the minister! A promise to fulfill demands in an election year? We did not embark on strike for over six months geared towards improving our public universities only to come back with mere promissory notes from a government that is notorious for reneging on agreements. I’m sure Nigerians would not forgive us.</p>



<p>“The current move by the Federal Government to jettison the principle of collective bargaining and reduce our Union’s objective and patriotic struggle to revamp and reposition public universities in Nigeria to mere award of miserly salaries, ranging from N30,000 to N60,000 is unacceptable to us.”</p>

<p>The Federal Government has said it was still not aware of reasons that caused the ongoing strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).</p>



<p>The Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, said this while speaking recently in Abuja.</p>



<p>According to Vanguard, he said, “Why they (ASUU) have chosen to go on strike is something that neither you nor I can explain. The engagement with ASUU has been a long drawn one, based on the 2009 agreement that was signed before we came into government.</p>



<p>It is our duty as government to give life to those agreement which ASUU rightly seeks to make sure that the universities that the federal government owns are properly funded.</p>



<p>The federal government’s funding is very limited and because of the additional challenges of security, it had to repeatedly borrow money to finance projects. This same borrowing is not available to build social infrastructure, it’s only available to build infrastructure that government can get return from, like railways.</p>



<p>To borrow and pay people is normally not what World Bank or other financial institutions borrow money for. However, the federal government has continued to address this by paying the salaries that are due.</p>



<p>Government is the one who pays, therefore, it is impractical and incongruous that somebody who is paid a salary continues to dictate for someone who pays him.”</p>



<p>It would be recalled that ASUU went a roll-over strike on February 14, 2022.</p>

<p>Indications emerged yesterday that the Federal Government may have implemented the ‘no work, no pay’ policy for the striking university-based unions.</p>



<p>This is even as the unions lamented that despite all the notices and letters sent to the federal government over the ongoing strike in the public universities, the government has not deemed it fit to either acknowledge the letters or call them to round table discussions.</p>



<p>Recall that the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, had embarked on a four week warning strike on February 14 which was extended at its expiration, following the alleged failure of government to address the contentious issues that led to the strike.</p>



<p>Vanguard reliably gathered that the federal government has invoked the ‘no work, no pay’ policy against the striking unions.</p>



<p>Confirming this, the President of NAAT, Comrade Ibeji Nwokoma, said members of his union were not paid full salaries in March.</p>
