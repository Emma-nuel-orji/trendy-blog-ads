<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The spokesperson of the Nigerian Police Force, Frank Mba has revealed the reasons why a lot of rapists get away with the crime in Nigeria.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He made this known in a chat on TVC. He said that the first reason why rape cases are never successfully prosecuted is because they are reported late. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He also disclosed that alteration of the crime scene largely affects the success of a rape investigation. He said,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8221;The fundamental problem for us as investigators are three. Number one is the fact that a lot of rape cases are reported very late and the fact that they are reported late, it impacts on the quality and the success of investigations. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The longer you stay in reporting a rape case, the higher the probability or the chances that evidence and the crime scene will be mismanaged.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although there is no status bar limiting the time you can report a rape case, you can even report twelve months later, but the earlier you report a rape case, the better and higher the chances of success.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frank Mba said that the most important part of a rape investigation is the management of the crime scene.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8221;As a matter of fact, in most crimes, how the crime scene is managed determines the success of investigations and people must remember that rape cases are even very special in the sense that in a rape case, there are two immediate crime scenes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first crime scene is place where the crime took place whether it is in a room, a car, a bush path or in a church like the case of Uwa. That particular place where the crime took place is a major crime scene.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The second crime scene is the body of the woman. Infact the body of the victim is a walking crime scene. It is a living crime scene. It is a mobile crime scene. And how we manage both the physical as well as that living crime scene will determine the success of an investigation.&#8221;</span></p>
