<p>Nyesom Wike has called on the River State Governor, Sim Fubara no to pull down the ladder he used in climbing.</p>



<p>Wike says this when he received traditional rulers in house house in the state during the weekend.</p>



<p>The former governor reportedly spoke at his residence in Port Harcourt, the state capital while addressing the traditional ruler of Ogbaland, who came to felicitate with him on the occasion of his birthday.</p>



<p>The chiefs and other members of the traditional institution from Ogbaland in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area of the state were led by their traditional ruler, Nwachukwu Nnam.</p>



<p>Wike assured the monarch that he would listen, insisting that he was disposed to peaceful resolution of the crisis.</p>



<p>The minister debunked claims that the political impasse was an ethnic war, insisting that it had no tribal colouration.</p>



<p>He said: “We didn’t vote based on ethnicity…but for the unity of Rivers. We shall never be part of violence but will always support peace.</p>



<p>“There are rules within the political group you emerge. You cannot say that because an Oba has emerged and then an Oba will not follow the rules of the traditional institution.</p>



<p>“No; an Oba will always obey the rules. So also in politics, there are things you must not do and there are things you must do.”</p>

<p>The Rivers State Governor, Siminalayi Fubara, on Wednesday congratulated his predecessor, Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Nyesom Wike, on the latter’s 56th birthday, amid political tension in the state.</p>



<p>In the birthday post shared on Fubara’s X page, the state governor hailed Wike as ‘my oga’, as he also showered prayers on the Federal Capital Territory Minister.</p>



<p>This is coming amid the political tension in the state as Fubara presented the 2024 Appropriation Bill to five members of the state House of Assembly. Twenty-seven lawmakers of the House recently defected from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress. The 27 members, loyal to Wike, were not present at the sitting on Wednesday.</p>
