<p>Land of Hope sends 150 hospital beds from Denmark to Nigeria.</p>



<p>Nigeria’s healthcare system has totally collapsed and Land of Hope wants to lead the way and rebuild a system that is supposed to save lives.</p>



<p>Herning hospital has closed down because one of Denmark’s new super-hospitals is ready to open in Western Denmark. The vision behind the new hospital is to create a modern hospital that is capable of truly world-class therapeutic and operational efficiency.</p>



<p>Thanks to Region Midtjylland Land of Hope was selected to receive hospital beds and medical equipment from the closed down hospital.</p>



<p>When Land of Hope was selected I contacted DSV &#8211; Global Transport and Logistics Denmark for support.</p>



<p>DSV Denmark has supported Land of Hope for many years and I was so excited when they said yes to ship 150 hospital beds for free all the way from Denmark to Nigeria.</p>



<p>To load 150 hospital beds in two gigantic containers is not easy and again I was overwhelmed with the news that Bop Scan Office ApS offered to support Land of Hope with manpower to make sure all 150 hospital beds were packed into the container and they got support from Mesterflyt <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Yesterday the first container was packed with 75 hospital beds and today the second container will be loaded with the rest of the hospital beds. I´m on my way to the hospital now…… More pictures and videos coming up.</p>



<p>Please help me send BIG thanks to:<br />Region Midtjylland<br />DSV &#8211; Global Transport and Logistics Denmark<br />Bop Scan Office ApS<br />Mesterflyt</p>



<p>For taking part in rebuilding Nigeria´s healtcare system.</p>

<p>Food is a vital detrimental factor in the way we look and how our body ages. Of course, most women want a youthful look and resort to many exercises and<a href="https://uae24x7.com/lifestyle/health/here-are-some-tips-for-a-balanced-diet/"> diet practices</a> to look young. While on the quest to search for that one perfect diet plan, you mostly meet with disappointment as there are several diet tips out there, but you have no idea which will suit you the most.</p>



<p>Fear not! In this article, you will find some of the best tips that will retain your youth in the years to come. These are little tips that you can take to change what you eat to make a huge impact on how your skin looks.</p>



<p>Did you know the food that you eat makes you look older? There are many food myths for youthful skin propagated by various authorities. This article will bust those myths with five essential tips that you can follow today for healthy skin and slow down the ageing process.</p>



<p>Eat Healthy Fats</p>



<p>For a long time, we were taught that fat is bad for you. Hence, in the late 90s and early 2000s, many people eat low-fat diets or even nonfat diets. There was nonfat salad dressings, nonfat or low-fat peanut butter. The food companies would remove fat from the products and add sugar. You have to realize that fat isn&#8217;t necessarily bad for you; it&#8217;s the type of fat that is the issue. There are healthy fats such as monosaturated fatty acids and omega-3 fatty acids that are good for you. And, the more you eat of that, the better your skin will look. These fats reduce inflammation and moisturize your skin from the inside out. Avocado, olive oil, and nuts are some great sources of healthy fats.</p>



<p>Ditch Dairy</p>



<p>Dairy does no good for your body. Dairy is inflammatory. There are proteins in it that our body does not react well to.&nbsp; If you’ve got acne, reduce your intake of dairy.</p>



<p>Eat More Fruits &amp; Vegetables</p>



<p>Fruits &amp; Vegetables are filled with antioxidants and phytonutrients. These antioxidants are mostly in the skin of fruits and vegetables. These are great for your skin to keep it young, supple, and healthy.</p>



<p>Get Rid Of Processed Foods</p>



<p>Processed foods are filled with chemicals and trans fats, which is not suitable for you. Hence, you should reduce the amount of processed foods to reduce the free radicals that your body is creating.&nbsp; You will also slow down the ageing process by reducing inflammation. So, stick to plants.</p>



<p>Reduce Your Sugar Intake</p>



<p>This is the most important tip that you should follow. Remember, sugar equals wrinkles. Desserts are not the only food item you should watch out for. Another source of sugar is white bread and rice. You should replace sugar with honey, jaggery, dates, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bonus Tip: Fasting also helps you to look younger.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Heat rash definition and facts</h2>



<p>Heat rash&nbsp;occurs when the skin&#8217;s sweat glands are blocked and the sweat produced can&#8217;t get to the floor of the pores and skin to evaporate. This reasons infection that outcomes in a&nbsp;rash.</p>



<p>Common symptoms of heat rash include red bumps on the skin, and a prickly or itchy feeling to the skin (also acknowledged as prickly heat).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_20200820_225348_800.jpg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-68644" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>The rash seems as reddened pores and skin with tiny&nbsp;blisters&nbsp;and is due to inflammation. It regularly takes place in skin creases or areas of tight garb the place air cannot circulate.</p>



<p>Heat rash normally fades when the skin is allowed to cool. Medical remedy is essential solely if the region will become infected.</p>



<p>Heat rash can be averted via warding off hot, humid conditions, sporting lose becoming clothes, and using air conditioning or fans to permit air to circulate.<br />The skin&#8217;s job is to shield the inside of the physique from the backyard world. It acts as a preventive barrier in opposition to intruders that purpose infection, chemicals, or ultraviolet light from invading or negative the body. It also plays an necessary function in the body&#8217;s temperature control. One way that the body cools itself is by&nbsp;sweating, and permitting that sweat or&nbsp;perspiration&nbsp;to evaporate. Sweat is manufactured in sweat glands that line the whole physique (except for a few small spots like fingernails, toenails, and the ear canal).</p>



<p>Sweat glands are positioned in the dermis or deep layer of the skin, and are regulated by the temperature manipulate facilities in the brain. Sweat from the gland receives to the floor of the pores and skin by way of a duct.</p>



<p>A warmness rash occurs when sweat ducts come to be clogged and the sweat cannot get to the floor of the skin. Instead, it will become trapped under the skin&#8217;s floor causing a mild infection or rash.</p>



<p>Heat rash is also called prickly heat or miliaria.</p>

<p>The Government of Ekiti state has directed traditional rulers in towns and villages to either postpone or cancel for the rest of the year, all pending local festivals in their domains to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>



<p>The State Coordinator of COVID-19 Task Force Response Team, Prof Bolaji Aluko, made the announcement in a statement in Ado Ekiti.</p>



<p>He disclosed that Ekiti State had cumulatively recorded 78 positive Coronavirus cases, with 29 active, 2 deaths and 47 discharged, warning that the cases can rise dramatically if public assemblies continued unchecked.</p>



<p>He said as the state was gradually entering the full blown season of Traditional Festival, therefore, travels from within Ekiti State and various parts of Nigeria by indigenes and visitors to the various towns and villages during this period of the pandemic, had started to occur.</p>



<p>According to him, the attendant incidents of virus transmission in these crowded and boisterous situations, where social distancing is practically impossible, and mask wearing, which is also required, may be impractical for prolonged times.</p>



<p><em>“Consequently, the wise course is to seriously discourage these festivals at this time.</em></p>



<p><em>&#8220;In fact, they are effectively banned by current government guidelines requiring social distancing and limited-number assemblies.&#8221;</em></p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Covid-19 Boss Mustapha said &#8220;We May Be Counting Bodies In Hundreds In Next 3 Weeks&#8221; </h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Secretary to the Government of the Federation and Chairman, of  Presidential Task Force on Covid-19, Mr. Boss Mustapha has warned that the country might start to count bodies in their hundreds in the next three weeks following the spread of coronavirus in the country.</h4>



<p>This is just as NCDC announced it had recorded 661 new cases, raising tally to 19,808, discharges 6,718, deaths 506. As usual, Lagos recorded the highest number of 230, followed by Rivers-127, Delta-83, FCT-60, Oyo-51, Edo-31, Bayelsa-27, Kaduna-25, Plateau-13, Ondo-6, Nasarawa-3, Ekiti-2, Kano-2, Borno-1.</p>



<p>Mustapha, who argued that the reason the numbers have continued to climb up lately was because the country has increased its testing capacity, however, noted that Nigeria was yet to even enter into the second wave of the pandemic, which according to him might be inevitable.</p>



<p>The SGF, who is disturbed about the attitudes of some Nigerians to the virus despite its rate of spread, noted that by the time the death tolls start coming in, the nation might enter into a serious panic mode, because the casualties would reflect the figures and the testing rate.</p>



<p>“There’ll be pandemonium and we might get into a panic mode. Sadly, we are still in the first wave and the figures will not abate, because the attitudes of a majority of the people do not suggest that we want the figures to abate,” Mustapha explained, urging Nigerians to support the government in the fight against Covid-19 by adhering to the safety protocols.</p>
