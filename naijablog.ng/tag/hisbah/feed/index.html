<p>The Kano State Hisbah Board has apprehended 11 Muslims for violating the Ramadan fast by eating during the day.</p>



<p>The arrests were made during the annual Ramadan enforcement operations, which included searches of eateries and markets.</p>



<p>The board’s Public Relations Officer, Lawal Ibrahim, who confirmed the arrests in an interview with the BBC Hausa Service monitored on Wednesday, said the arrests were made on Tuesday across the city, particularly near markets.<br />“The individuals arrested include 10 men and one woman, who was caught eating from her groundnut-selling stall,” he said.</p>



<p>He explained that non-Muslims are exempted from such enforcement activities, but if found selling food during fasting hours to Muslims, they could be considered in violation.<br />“We apprehended 11 persons on Tuesday, including a lady selling groundnuts who was seen eating from her wares, after some persons alerted us. The other 10 persons were men and were arrested across the city, especially close to markets where a lot of activities happen. We don’t arrest non-Muslims because this doesn’t concern them, and the only time they could be guilty of a crime is when we find out they cook food to sell to Muslims who are supposed to be fasting,” he said.</p>

<p>“We (Hisbah) have confirmed that Shatu Garko is a Muslim from Kano State and her parents come from Garko Local Government Area. Kano is a Sharia state and this is why we won’t allow the matter to go like that.</p>



<p>“We will invite the parents to talk to them about the actions of their daughter and the fact that what she did was illegal in Islam in case they don’t know so that she won’t continue on that path and other girls will not copy her,” Ibn Sina told BBC News Pidgin.</p>

<p>Islamic Police known as Hisbah in Kano has given reasons behind constant humiliation of commoners and leave rich people even they violate the same Sharia law.</p>



<p>A director of the Islamic police in the state, Aliyu Kibiya who give the reason when he featured on a Freedom Radio programme, says Islam is against disgracing rich people in Public.</p>



<p><br>According to Kibiya, it is against the tenets of Islam to publicly criticise a leader.</p>



<p>He said, “Although we call on everybody in the society to do the right thing, we make the call on a case by case basis.</p>



<p>“It is against the tenets of Islam to mount the podium and call out leaders. There are ways to caution a leader without criticising him in public.&#8221;</p>



<p>Recall that Many Huasa Celebrities has come under attack for uploading photo on social media.</p>



<p>Daughter in-law to president Muhammad Buhari, who recently got married to Buhari son go against Islam rule by taken photo without her head cover, nothing was done about her by the Islamic police.</p>



<p>Also few years ago, Kano State governor, Ganduje Daughter did same, taken photo without her head cover during her wedding, she even go further to have party with different musicians which is against Islam, Hisbah didn&#8217;t do anything about that.</p>



<p>But Hishah has in recent time humiliating ordinary boys on the street because of their hair cut which they said is against Islam.</p>

<p class="first">Sesugh Akume, a businessman, has asked a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja to stop the destruction of alcoholic drinks by Islamic Police, Hisbah </p>



<p>In the same document, Akume sue  Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC.</p>



<p>The court document read, &#8220;An order and declaration that the manufacture/production, transportation/haulage distribution sales, consumption or possession of alcoholic beverages are NOT forbidden in Nigeria by the Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria or any extant federal law; therefore any subsidiary legislation criminalising same is unconstitutional, null and void and of no consequence whatsoever.</p>



<p>&#8220;An order and declaration that the destruction of alcoholic beverages bottles and wasting of the content is an act of economic sabotage.</p>



<p>&#8220;A declaration that destroying a source value-added tax one enjoys is a contradiction and hypocritical. An order is compelling the 2nd Respondent(EFCC) to deter and publish the extent of financial loss for every act of destruction of alcoholic beverages and wasting its content, and prosecuting offenders under extant laws.</p>



<p>&#8220;An order and declaration that retaining and utilising any allocation, value-added tax, or any funds distributed by the federal government or give to others.</p>



<p>&#8220;The manufacture/production, transportation/haulage, distribution, sales, consumption, or possession of alcoholic beverages is not forbidden by the Federal Republic of Nigeria&#8217;s Constitution. The Constitution being the supreme law of the land to which every other legislation that contradicts it becomes a nullity.</p>



<p>&#8220;The alcoholic beverages industry is a top money earner for the country and a means of employment and livelihood for millions; therefore, any deliberate destruction and wastage of such products is economic sabotage.</p>



<p>&#8220;The EFFC must assess and determine the extent of financial loss for every such destruction and prevent and prosecute offenders. Retaining and utilising VAT from alcohol (and other &#8216;unethical&#8217; sources like the lottery, gambling, etc.) is not compulsory; recipients may return the same to the federal government or donate to others.</p>



<p>&#8220;An interpretation of the statutes to address these issues becomes urgent and vital. For instance, the Kano State Hisbah Board, for example, on Friday, March 12 2010, destroyed 34,000 bottles of different alcoholic beverages, wasting its content.</p>



<p>&#8220;The practice continued, and on Wednesday 27, November 2013, it destroyed 244,151 bottles of alcohol and prosecuted dealers in it, and this has been a yearly occurrence. On Sunday, September 22, 2019, thedestroyed 196,400 bottles worth more than 50 million naira, and this last year, on Sunday, November 08, 2020, they destroyed 1,975,000 bottles of alcohol worth up to half a billion naira; copies of the media reports of these wanton destruction are attached and marked as Exhibit 1A-1D.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not only Kano is involved in this destruction of alcoholic beverages bottles and arresting dealers, but other states are also involved. For instance, 588 bottles of beer were wasted in Jigawa on Monday, August 24 2020. A copy of the media report of this wanton destruction is attached and marked as Exhibit 2.&#8221;</p>

<p>Usman said, “The latest update on the case is that it was transferred to the police, fully investigated by the police and the outcome of their investigation is that the man is innocent of all the charges; the allegations were false. The lady is a daughter to him, there is a marital issue between the woman and her husband&#8217;s family so they had to lodge her in a hotel pending the time they would resolve the matter.</p>



<p>“They didn&#8217;t even allow her family to reach out to her but her father got to know about it and was taking food to her in the hotel. When people saw that a Hisbah official was going to the hotel, they started shouting that a Hisbah officer had gone to meet a married woman in the hotel and all that, without even knowing she is his daughter.</p>



<p>“The man right now is devastated, he has filed a petition against Freedom Radio through his solicitors. They will have to pay N10 million in damages and he said they would have to retract the publication and offer a public apology to him. He might go after other media houses though but we are not sure yet.”</p>
