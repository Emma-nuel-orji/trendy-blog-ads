<p>The lawmaker representing Esan North-East/South-East federal constituency of Edo State in the House of Representatives, Hon. Sergius Ogun has stated that the companies producing major toilet wash products are misleading Nigerians.</p>



<p>He asserted that the advertisements of major toilet wash products in the market and reality are contradictory to their potency.</p>



<p>In the motion moved by the lawmaker on Tuesday, Ogun argued that toilet cleaning disinfectants such as Harpic and Hypo used in most households in Nigeria are ineffective, of poor quality and leave much to be desired, according to Daily Post.</p>



<p>He said, “Despite the poor quality of these toilet cleaning disinfectants, there are several television sponsored advertisements that are misleading unsuspecting members of the public who rely on such adverts product information to make purchases;<br />“Section 17(e) of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission Act, 2018 empowers the Commission to carry out investigations considered necessary or desirable in connection with matters within the purview of the Act.”</p>



<p>However, the House of Representatives resolved to investigate the effectiveness of major toilet wash products in the market.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives Committee on the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), on Wednesday, interrogated officials of the Central Bank of Nigeria, the Accountant-General of the Federation and the Auditor-General of the Federation over an alleged N82.5bn spent by the NNDC between January and May 2020. The committee’s chairman, Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo (APC, Ondo), said&nbsp;the documents submitted by both the CBN and the Auditor-General of the Federation showed that the total amount spent by the NDDC from January to May 2020 was N81.5 billion. CBN, AGF appear before Reps over N81.5bn NDDC expenditure in 5 months Reps grill NDDC boss over extra-budgetary spending He said the commission claimed to have spent N1.3bn on community relations, N122.9m on condolences, N83m on consultancy and N3.14bn on COVID-19, N486m Duty Travel Allowance, N790.9m as imprest, N1.956bn on Lassa Fever, N900m on Legal Service, N220m on maintenance, N85.6m on foreign travels, N1.121bn on public projects communication, N744m on security, N8.8bn on staffing-related payment. He said the NDDC also spent N248m on stakeholders’ engagement from February 18 to May 31, 2020. </p>



<p>The Auditor-General, Anthony Ayine and the representative of the Accountant-General, Sabo Mohammed, confirmed the N81.5bn transactions being investigated. Ayine said there should be punitive measures to discourage agencies violating the constitution.</p>



<p> The NDDC Interim Management Committee members were not present at the hearing, but wrote a letter to the investigative hearing committee informing it of an invitation to the Federal Executive Council meeting and requested to appear on Thursday. </p>



<p> House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts, on Monday 13 July, grilled the acting Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission, Pondei Kemerbrandikumo, over the alleged N90.4bn extra-budgetary expenditure by the commission from 2009 to 2011. The committee cited the audit query by the Auditor-General of the Federation that the NDDC allegedly paid N23.215bn to contractors for 2008 to 2012 for 150 projects now stalled. Responding, Kemerbrandikumo explained that the extra-budgetary expenditure arose because of the late passage of the agency’s budgets in the period under review. On the alleged 150 abandoned projects, he said the NDDC was making efforts towards recovering the funds from various contractors through the banks that raised Advanced Project Guarantees on their behalf. Meanwhile, the Senate Committee on Niger Delta Development Commission on Monday slammed the Interim Management Committee of the Niger Delta Development Commission for failing to honour its invitation over alleged misappropriation of N40bn.</p>



<p>Rift in NDDC Ousted managing director of the NDDC, Joy Nunieh, had accused the Niger Delta affairs minister, Godswill Akpabio, of orchestrating her removal from office, but the minister said she was being insubordinate. Nunieh, a former Acting Managing Director of Interim Management Committee of the NDDC, served as NDDC acting MD between October 29, 2019 to February 28, 2020 before the committee was sacked. She alleged on the side lines of the Senate investigative hearing probing NDDC’s misappropriation of N40 billion that Akpabio engineered her removal from office for failing to dance to his tunes regarding the spending of the Commission. Nunieh said: “Nobody makes any payment in NDDC without Godswill Akpabio’s approval.</p>



<p> “When we first came, on the day of the inauguration, he said to me in the car, ‘Madam MD, if you don’t do what I say, the same pen with which I used to sign your paper is the same pen I’ll use to remove you.” </p>



<p>But reacting to Nunieh’s allegations, Akpabio said the former NDDC MD was removed because of insubordination and for skipping the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). “She was relieved of her appointment because of insubordination,” Akpabio said when he featured on AriseTV News Saturday night. “My ministry, which supervises her, wrote several letters to her but she never responded to one,” he added. The minister said he had received petitions from anti-corruption agency that Nunieh didn’t have the requisite qualifications to work as acting MD of a commission. He said Nunieh was removed after the discovery that there was no record in the national headquarters of NYSC to prove her participation in the scheme. “We have written to her to explain but she had not responded,” Akpabio added. </p>

<p>The Nigerian House of Representatives through its Committee on Basic Education and Services has faulted FG’s decision to cancel the 2019/2020 West African Senior School Certificate Examination, WASSCE due to Covid-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Recall that the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba had earlier said that the examinations scheduled to hold from August 4 to September 5 would no longer hold in the country.</p>



<p>According to him,</p>



<p> &#8220;<em>Nigerian schools will not reopen any time soon “until it is safe to do so because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</em></p>



<p><em>Our schools will only open when we believe it’s safe for our children and that is when the situation is right, not when the incidence of the infection is going up in the nation. I just want to make it clear. We will not open schools soon for examination or for any reason unless it is safe for our children, even WAEC. WAEC will not determine for us what we do. Schools will remain closed.”</em> he said</p>



<p>The Minister stressed that it is better for Nigerian students to lose an academic year than to expose them to dangers.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in a statement released on Saturday, July 10, 2020, the House Committee on Basic Education and Services said the reversal in the decision for students not to write their WAEC examination is not in the interest of the country as it will create confusion in the education sector.</p>



<p>The statement reads in part; “The House Committee on Basic Education and Services received with amazement the announcement by the Honourable Minister of Education that Nigerian students would not be participating in the forthcoming WASSCE examinations.</p>



<p>He did not inform the country if this was in agreement with other West African leaders or in consultation with the examination bodies, the state governments and other stakeholders in the education sector.</p>



<p>The Minister also did not also inform the public if the decision was the outcome of a meeting with all State Governments that are in charge of all but the Unity Secondary Schools that are owned by the Federal government.</p>



<p>The Hon. Minister of State, in his usually consultative and participatory approach, had briefed the nation at the COVID-19 presidential Committee briefing, over the airwaves and in an appearance before the House Committee on Basic Education, where he assured Nigerians that all steps had or were being taken to ensure full compliance with COVID-19 protocols.</p>



<p>This sudden policy reversal is not good for the country. It is bound to create further confusion in the education sector, create disappointment and suspicion among parents, frustrate the students, and show to our development partners and Nigerians that the distortions and disarticulations in the sector are only getting worse,” it stated.</p>



<p>The Committee called on FG to rescind its decision as Nigeria is not the only country expected to write the examination amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>“<em>The House Committee appreciates the reservations of the Honourable Minister of Education. We are parents just like him. No Nigerian parent would want to delay, distort, even terminate the progress of their child.</em></p>



<p><em>We are convinced that if our policy of no boarding house, reconceptualising scope of exams, use of all classrooms and halls in the schools, quadrupling the number of invigilators, provision of facemasks, sanitizers and hand washing facilities are followed, the WASSCE can be conducted with ease and with no repercussions”</em> the statement in read.</p>

<p>Drama ensued when the Lebanese Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr Houssam Diab walked out of a meeting with the members of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Shortly after entering Conference  Room 236, New Building, House Wing of the National Assembly complex, Diab reportedly walked out on the Committee on Diaspora Affairs who he was supposed to meet.</p>
<p>Present at the meeting were the Director-General of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons, Julie Okah-Donli; Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr Zubairu Dada; officials of the Federal Ministries of Justice and of Labour, Employment and Productivity as well as Nigerians in Diaspora Commission.</p>
<p>The Lebanese ambassador expected to have a close-door meeting with the members of the House of Representatives only.</p>
<p>He was overwhelmed by the number of people present at the meeting venue and walked out around 10.50 am as the meeting was about to start in the open.</p>
<p>Chairman of the committee, Akande-Sadipe said,</p>
<p>“It was an informal meeting because the Ambassador was nice enough to join us at the meeting. There is no law that says he has to be here today but because he has an interest in the joint relationship between Nigeria and Lebanon.</p>
<p>We have a lot of Nigerians in Lebanon and we have a lot of Lebanese in Nigeria. We have a relationship with Lebanon from the 50s…</p>
<p>This meeting today has further reiterated that the Lebanese community and the Nigerian community always stand together to ensure that justice and respect for human lives is a priority, and we will work together to bring modern-day slavery to an end.”</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-55002" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200624-WA0000-363x315.jpg?resize=363%2C315&#038;ssl=1" alt="House of Reps reject Ghana's apology, drags Onyeama" width="363" height="315" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The House of Representatives has dragged Geoffrey Onyeama, the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>This is because he claimed that Ghana has apologised to Nigeria on the demolition of buildings of the Nigerian Embassy in the country.</p>
<p>The House, while dismissing the call for diplomatic negotiations by the minister, asked that Nigeria should reciprocate the demolition, which the parliament described as an attack on the country.</p>
<p>Onyeama had appeared before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs in Abuja on Tuesday, where he was being grilled over demolition of the buildings.</p>
<p>Earlier in his presentation, the minister told the lawmakers that there was an invasion and building in the embassy premises was demolished by non-state actors.</p>
<p>He also said the time it took for the Ghanaian authorities to respond to distress calls made by officials at the embassy “is extremely troubling and troubling.”</p>
<p>Onyeama further said the traditional ruler in the area claimed that the property belonged to him, saying that there is no justification for the leader to take laws into his hands.</p>
<p>He also informed the House that the President of Ghana had directed that decisive and severe measure be taken to settle the matter.</p>
<p>Onyeama said the legal status of the property will be looked into before further actions will be taken.</p>
<p>He added that Nigeria had sought the security of the embassy, its members of staff, and all Nigerians in Ghana.</p>
<p>The minister also said the Government of Ghana is very remorseful and had apologised profusely for the invasion.</p>
<p>Responding to Onyeama, Gbajabiamila dismissed the apology the minister said had been tendered to Nigeria by Ghana.</p>
<p>He stated that Nigeria must reciprocate the attack on its sovereignty by Ghana. The speaker said,</p>
<p>“We all have the responsibility to make sure that we uphold, very simply, the honour and glory of the country we serve.</p>
<p>Honourable minister, let me commend you for your efforts so far; what you’ve done and what you’ve been doing.</p>
<p>I think we should look at this thing from the premise that the Nigerian state was attacked. It was not a building that was demolished, no; the Nigerian state was attacked.</p>
<p>I think if we look at it from that premise, we will begin to understand or underscore the importance or gravity of what we are dealing with.</p>
<p>In terms of immunity and inviolability, in terms of diplomacy, it also extends to property. We are not just talking about the states.</p>
<p>It is trite that the embassy of any country is actually the state – a sovereign location in that, particularly foreign country.</p>
<p>That is why if there is any problem in Nigeria today, all the Americans will run to the American Embassies to seek shelter because you cannot even move near there.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ahmed Jaha, a member of the House of Representatives has openly regretted and renounced the comments he made at Thursday’s plenary. He gave a sincere apology to Nigerians, especially women.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an interview on Saturday in Abuja, Ahmed Jaha reversed his comments at the debate that women should cultivate a habit of proper dressing to avoid unnecessary harassment from men who could not control themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The lawmaker, representing Chibok, Damboa, Gwoza Federal Constituency of Borno, said he regretted making such a statement as it affected the sensitivity of women. He said,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I have made a mistake that has offended the sensibilities of fellow Nigerians and indeed, fellow human beings, particularly women who are our mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While I totally reaffirm my position that rapists should face death sentences, I regret the part that talks about the dressing of women.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I deeply apologise for this position, because as some have rightly argued, my comments, could imply that women who are victims, share the blame of being raped.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This clearly, could not have been the intention of someone who suggested a death penalty for rapists”.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The lawmaker said that there were three sets of people who never made mistakes – “the dead, those incapacitated and those that are healthy, but useless to the society”.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jaha said a woman’s choice of dressing could not justify rape, saying that if women who were the weaker sex show discipline by looking away when men were not well dressed, men should even do better.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I know that it is a divine responsibility for every good man to protect and preserve the pride of a woman.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most women are born with the natural strength of endurance, that is why they are able to go through childbirth, to nurture families, take care of relations and still able to earn descent livelihoods.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Women do things with completeness. I admire this so much, because I have benefited from the sincerity and commitment of women.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I hold women with the highest respect, with great pride and with so much love that is pure and responsible,” the parliamentarian added.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ahmed Jaha also apologised to his colleagues in the house and his constituents who might have been disappointed by his comments, especially female lawmakers.</span></p>
