<p>Babangida, who served as head of state between 1985 and 1993 shared his view on recent agitations for Biafra and Yoruba nations during an interview on Arise TV on Friday.</p>



<p>“It is always good to agitate but because there is this belief that this country should be one.</p>



<p>“When they make the noise, they find that it won’t get supported because Nigerians generally don’t believe in anything that would disturb their peace of mind. They won’t do it.</p>



<p>“If you look back, if you take a place like Baga, in the north-east, the Igbo man, Yoruba man travelled up to Baga for trading, he lived very comfortably, he lived very well with the people around there.”</p>



<p>“Let me repeat here that Nigeria is a united and indivisible country. Our constitution has taken care of that. I don’t see secession as the way out of the current challenges afflicting the nation. Instead, advocates of secession should have a change of heart and I recommend dialogue as a crucial option for addressing their problems.</p>



<p>“The Biafran agitators and a small section of the Yoruba nation agitating for Oduduwa Republic should therefore always have this at the back of their minds in their political calculations and transformations.</p>

<p>Nigerian Former head of State, Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, IBB, finally reacted on the secessionist agendas rocking the country.</p>



<p>In a trending interview on Arise TV on Friday, former Military leader said Nigerians do not believe in Secession.</p>



<p>When asked about his take on the secession agitations from the South-West(Yoruba nation) and the South-east (IPOB).</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>He said; “It is always good to agitate but because there is this belief that this country should be one. When they make the noise, they find that it won’t get supported, because Nigerians generally don’t believe in anything that would disturb their peace of mind. They won’t do it.” </p></blockquote>



<p>He added that politicians were to blame for the deep disunity in the country.</p>



<p>He pointed out that there was a time people held positions outside their ethnic regions and expressed sadness at the present crop of leaders.</p>



<p>He added that the current set of politicians in the country were not serious about nation-building.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“If you look back, if you take a place like Baga, in the north-east, the Igbo man, Yoruba man travelled up to Baga for trading, he lived very comfortably, he lived very well with the people around there,” he said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Former Military President, Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, IBB, has admitted he is taking a long time in writing his memoirs because he is scared of being sued.</p>



<p>IBB, while speaking on Channels Television on Friday night, also said he wanted to do a thorough job of it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IBB.jpg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-74068" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>“I am scared of somebody suing me to court to say that I libelled somebody or that I misrepresented somebody and I will spend five years going to court,” Babangida said.</p>



<p>When asked of his friends’ opinion about being bound by the oath of secrecy to keep some issues to himself, he responded: “Don’t forget, not only in Nigeria but throughout the world.</p>



<p>“For a certain number of years beyond which anybody will punish you, for opening the secret because you have passed a certain period.</p>



<p>“It (memoirs) will come but if it doesn’t come my children will go into the classroom and research. Everything that will need research about us we have<br />in abundance. I know that General Obasanjo has a library that is very rich.”</p>

<p>This is as the Elder Statesman marks his 79th Birthday Anniversary on 17th August 2020.</p>



<p>In a congratulatory message made available in a statement by his Chief Press<br />Secretary(CPS), Mrs Mary Noel Berje to the former military president, the Governor said IBB&#8217;s doggedness and resolve in nation-building were crucial to the stability, national and international unity as well as development of the country.</p>



<p>These he said have remained invaluable guardian for the nation&#8217;s quest.</p>



<p>&#8220;I congratulate you on this special day of commemorating your birth. On a day like this, memories of your courage, invaluable service to the Nigerian Army in protecting the sovereignty of the country and your exemplary leadership which have indeed helped as well as stimulated the younger generations come to mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;My fervent prayer for you is to continue to get good health and may Almighty Allah also strengthen you and grant you more blessed years to continue to reap the reward of your hard work&#8221;. He said.</p>



<p>According to him, the elder statesman&#8217;s policies and programmes during his regime as the Military President in the country between 1985 and 1993 still stand the test of time, adding that the celebrant has continued to symbolize Statesmanship, Patriotism, Professionalism, vision and Courage even after active service to the Nation.</p>



<p>He said even as the Former Military President is advancing in age, he s remains an asset to the country, where his wise counsel and advice are needed for the growth and development of the State in particular and the Nation at large</p>
