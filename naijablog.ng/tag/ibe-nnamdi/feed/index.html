<p>Let&#8217;s say I give you a book titled &#8220;How to drive&#8221; and you read it.</p>



<p>Does it mean you know how to drive?<br />What you have is knowledge of driving.</p>



<p>Until you get into a car and start driving, you actually don&#8217;t know how to drive.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s my process about learning as an individual and a business owner,<br />I don&#8217;t read everything to store information in my head.</p>



<p>I learn a few things at a time, and practice the hell out of them.</p>



<p>I read two chapters of Akin Alabi&#8217;s book &#8220;How to sell to NIGERIANS&#8221; and I stopped.</p>



<p>I spent the next two weeks practicing how to create offers to sell bottled water which is normal sold at N100, for N1000.<br />And I don&#8217;t sell bottled water.<br />Then I continued.</p>



<p>Last year, I took Chioma Ifeanyi-Eze course on how to create Ebooks. I stopped at Video 3 or so. For the 12 days, I practiced creating hot captions and titles.<br />Then I continued.</p>



<p>I sat down with Emeka Nobis to create a strategy to sell UNSACKABLE in September 2021.</p>



<p>I practiced and used the strategies we created, and I&#8217;m still practicing and using, till today..</p>



<p>The secret is simple.<br />LEARN SMALL.<br />PRACTICE BIG.</p>
