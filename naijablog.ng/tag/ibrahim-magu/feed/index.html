<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-71731" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Malami.jpg?resize=476%2C287&#038;ssl=1" alt="Abubakar Malami - I'm willing to testify against Magu" width="476" height="287" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Abubakar Malami, the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), has said that if he is invited by the Justice Ayo Salami-led presidential investigative panel, he is ready to testify against the suspended acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu.</p>
<p>A panel headed by Mr Salami, a former president of the Court of Appeal, is currently investigating Mr Magu over allegations of graft and insubordination levelled against him by Mr Malami.</p>
<p>The complaint of Mr Malami led to the suspension of Mr Magu as acting EFCC chairman, after the investigation of the activities of the latter at the EFCC from May 2015 to May 2020.</p>
<p>The AGF was reacting to a letter by Wahab Shittu, counsel to Mr Magu, dated September 4 and addressed to the committee chairman, demanding that Mr Malami, appear before the panel to provide evidence regarding his allegations against his client.</p>
<p>He said that his appearance before the tribunal of Inquiry would ensure a fair hearing.</p>
<p>Citing Sections 5(c) and 6 of the Tribunals of Inquiry Act 2004, Mr Shittu said that the tribunal has “the power to summon any person in Nigeria to attend any meeting of the tribunal to give evidence or produce any document or other thing in his possession and to examine him as a witness or require him to produce any document or other thing in his possession, subject to all just exceptions.</p>

<p>On the ongoing Economic and Financial Crimes Commission(EFCC) saga, President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the establishment of a Judicial Commission of Enquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry Act (Cap T21, LFN, 2004), to investigate the alleged financial impropriety and mismanagement of recovered assets levelled against the suspended acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Mr Ibrahim Magu.</p>



<p>The president named the following as members of the panel: Justice Isa Ayo Salami (rtd) – North Central (Kwara) – chairman; DIG Anthony Ogbizi Michael (NPF)- South -South – Deputy chairman; Muhammad Abubakar Babadoko (FMOJ)- North Central- member; Hassan Yahaya Abdullahi (DSS) – North Central (Member); Muhammad Shamsuddeen (OAGF)- North West (Member); Douglas Egweme (NFIU) – South-East (Member) and Barr Kazeem Attitebi – South-West – Secretary.</p>



<p>Recall that Magu was arrested on July 6, 2020 in front of the Wuse office of the EFCC and directed to appear before the Salami- led panel.</p>



<p>It is important to state that certain witnesses have testified against Magu while the latter was said to have been served with the allegations and terms of reference on Saturday, August 8, 2020.</p>



<p>Multiple sources close to the Presidency also disclosed that the panel has been given 45 days to submit its report.</p>



<p>It is not certain if the numbers of days already spent by the panel so far would be deemed as part of the 45-day timeline as the panel has been sitting in private, barring journalists from covering its proceedings.</p>



<p>Allegations against Magu included alleged discrepancies in the reconciliation records of the EFCC and the Federal Ministry of Finance<br />on recovered funds, declaration of N504b as recovered funds instead of N543b found in the CBN recovery account.</p>



<p>He was also accused of insubordination to the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation, (AGF).</p>



<p>Magu was accused of not providing enough evidences for the extradition of Diezani Alison-Madueke and alleged late action on the investigation of P&amp;ID leading to legal dispute.</p>



<p>These allegations were listed in the memo sent to President Buhari.</p>

<p>The suspended Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Acting Chairman, Ibrahim Magu, seems not to be backing down anytime soon as his legal team has thrown 10 questions to the Presidency and Justice Ayo Salami-led Presidential Panel probing the embattled former chairman of the agency </p>



<p>Magu insists that the allegations against him were fabricated, and meant to tarnish his image and the anti-graft agency&#8217;s credibility.</p>



<p>In a statement, one of Magu’s lead counsels, Tosin Ojaomo, urged the Justice Salami Panel to be just and fair in its probe.</p>



<p>During Magu’s incarceration, DCP Idowu Owohunwa, the Principal Staff Officer, PSO, to the Inspector-General of Police, IGP, Mohammed Adamu, wrote to Ojaomo.</p>



<p>The PSO told the Lawyer that the suspended EFCC Head was being held by the Presidency, and not the Police.</p>



<p>Now, Ojaomo wants answers from the Presidency and Salami’s Panel.</p>



<p>He said:</p>



<p> “Why is the Panel inviting suspects facing EFCC trial?</p>



<p> “What is the basis of the Panel’s invitation to a Senior Lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, SAN, a Lawyer that is defending the looters of our common patrimony, especially those who are under EFCC’s investigations and trial?</p>



<p>“Is it not curious that while the Lawyer to Magu, Wahab Shittu, deliberately refused to disclose what transpired before the Panel, Ozekhome and Obla issued statements and made public what transpired before the Panel?</p>



<p>“What is the propriety of the Panel’s invitation to a disgruntled Official of the EFCC, Nuru Buhari Dalhatu, to come and testify against Magu, while the said Dalhatu is under investigation for misconduct and fraternising with suspects?</p>



<p>“What is the justification for the Panel’s invitation of another Senior Lawyer, Godwin Obla, SAN, who is currently facing EFCC’s trial, with an indicted Judge of the Federal High Court?</p>



<p>“Is it not strange that Obla made a damning revelation on what transpired before the Panel, and went ahead to demand for his outrageous legal fees of N763 million, and the striking out of the charge against him?</p>



<p>“Why is the Panel hostile to Magu, at any time he tried to take up issues with those invited to testify against him?</p>



<p>“How come that a fact finding Panel over allegations of corruption against Magu, has now turned to a platform where certain individuals whose actions and antecedents fit into the description, “corruption enablers”, as well as “haters of the war against corruption” and its leadership, are being invited to testify against Mr. Magu?</p>



<p>“There is the need to ask this important question: Has any witness testified that he or she gave XYZ amount to Magu, in order to compromise cases before him?</p>



<p>“Why is it that the Salami-led Panel is yet to serve and confront Magu with all the allegations against him, and what are the terms of reference of the Panel?”</p>



<p>Magu was suspended for alleged mismanagement and corrupt practices levied against him by the Abubakar Malami led presidential panel committee.</p>

<p>Ibrahim Magu, the suspended acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has claimed that some powerful toes he stepped on while doing his job were out to tarnish his image and destroy his reputation.</p>



<p>Magu told the Presidential Committee On Audit Of Recovered Assets, PCARA, that suspects and other criminal elements he prosecuted were after him.</p>



<p>Magu’s claims were contained in a response he addressed to the PCARA probing the mismanagement and lack of transparency in managing recovered assets by the anti-corruption agency in the last 5 years.</p>



<p>The embattled suspended EFCC boss denied any wrongdoing while in office, insisting that all he did was fight corruption to a standstill in the country.</p>



<p>He said his traducers were out there publishing false information about him on social media platforms.</p>



<p>Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, had in the petition he submitted to the PCARA claimed that the lack of proper record keeping and discrepancies in the recovery figures, was a dent on the anti-corruption drive as well as raising integrity issues that can lead to loss of public confidence.</p>



<p>Part of Malami’s petition said, “For instance, EFCC stated 836 as the number of recovered real estate in the original returns it made to Mr. President on 07/04/2017.</p>



<p>“However, in its 1st returns to PCARA on 13/12/2017, EFCC gave the figure of 339, while in the 2nd returns to PCARA on 09/03/2018, it stated the recoveries to be 504. The 1st and 2nd returns total 843.”</p>



<p>“Some of the suspects under investigation and prosecution are always ganging up to fight me back, publishing false, untrue, malicious and libellous allegations against me. I have never abused the office I am occupying at the pleasure of Mr. President.”</p>



<p>“I have never personally enriched myself whilst performing my official function. I challenge my accusers to produce any evidence of this purported personal enrichment,” Magu said.</p>



<p>Arguing further, he claimed that under his watch, there were no cases of mismanagement of recovered assets or funds.</p>



<p>“No assets were sold and the proceeds thereof converted. There has been no mismanagement of or lack of transparency in the management of recovered assets under my leadership of the Commission. There has been no diversion of proceeds from recovered assets or personal enrichment on my part. A careful investigation into what has been recovered and what has been paid into the appropriate accounts will easily confirm this.</p>



<p>“I unequivocally deny these allegations as same are untrue and merely calculated to tarnish my name, that of the Commission, and the giant strides this administration has recorded in the fight against corruption and recovery of the proceeds of corruption,” .</p>



<p>“I am innocent. I have served my country to the best of my abilities with all sense of responsibility and integrity,” Magu insisted.</p>



<p>He maintained that the records of his achievements are there for all to see.</p>



<p>“I respectfully invite the panel to note the stellar and unprecedented achievements of the EFCC under my watch as the acting Chairman,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The embattled and suspended Acting Chairman of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission,(EFCC) Mallam Ibrahim Magu, has debunked a report pavading social media  that he mismanaged and could not account for the sum of N329bn retrieved for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).</p>



<p>The fund was directly remitted into NNPC accounts via REMITTA under a special arrangement endorsed by the oil firm, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the affected indebted marketers, Magu Said.</p>



<p>In a statement by his lawyer, Wahab Shittu on Sunday disclosed that Magu formally requested the commission to recover the said amount from NNPC’s marketers and in turn confirmed the receipt of the fund. </p>



<p>Speaking further, Shittu said the anti-graft agency never took custody of any of the retrieved funds.  It reads, “We wish to express our profound gratitude for the successful collaboration between the EFCC and PPMC/NNPC which largely resulted in the huge recovery of debts from the marketers from the inception of the recovery exercise in 2016 till date. </p>



<p>“We appreciate your commission’s professional and diligent handling of the recovery of debts from the marketers throughout the period and we look forward to further collaboration in further areas&#8221;. </p>



<p>&#8220;The recovered funds for NNPC was  never featured in the proceedings of the Presidential panel and our client has never been confronted with such allegations. “Our client is alarmed at the motive behind such spurious allegations in spite of altruistic service to the country without personal pecuniary benefits.</p>



<p>&#8220;On the claim that Magu was questioned by the Presidential panel over assets declaration, Shittu said that his client has never been confronted with any of such allegations. He said the report was false and being orchestrated in the public space to malign and discredit the work of his client in the fight against corruption.</p>



<p>Shittu said while reacting to the false claim that Magu failed to elaborate the rationale for exclusion of culprits in the alleged misapplication of N3bn at the Federal Inland Revenue Service(FIRS), that the  matter had been referred for prosecution and charges had been prepared ahead of arraignment in court, therefore the question of complicity by Magu does not arise.</p>



<p>Shittu also said, &#8220;Our client did not give any express or implied directive that anyone indicted be excluded from the legal process. Our client has no interest in shielding anyone found culpable from the long arms of the law. At any rate, time does not run against the state in criminal prosecutions.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;My client would no longer be silent in the face of sustained malicious attacks to prejudge him in the public space. He added, &#8220;Take notice that our client can no longer fold his hands in the face of these sustained malicious attacks to prejudge him in the public space. </p>



<p>&#8220;Our client will henceforth point by point reply to all false allegations orchestrated by mischievous person (s) against him in the public space on a daily basis as well as present his comprehensive defense for the world to see. &#8220;This is without prejudice to the willingness of our client to defend himself in the ongoing proceedings at the Presidential investigation panel.”</p>

<p>Presidency has said that the invitation of the suspended acting Chairman of Economic and Financial crime commission, (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu for questioning is for the best interest of Magu.</p>



<p class="first">The Special Adviser to President Muhammad Buhari on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina Who speak to newsmen Short After Magu was release from detention  said Magu, was not on trial.</p>



<p>Adesina said Magu was only invited by the Justice Ayo Salami-led Presidential panel to his tell his own side of the story.</p>



<p>The suspended EFCC boss was arrested and detained on Monday, July 6, 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Magu for the past one week has been appearing before a presidential panel for investigation of the alleged corruption and insubordination levelled against him by Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami.</p>



<p>On while Magu was detained for long if he was just invited for questioning? Adesina said, he was not a lawyer and as such he could not comment on legal matters.</p>



<p>He said, “If anything illegal has been done, there are ways to seek redress for it but I think it is in the best interest of everybody including Magu for the panel to have invited him to hear his side of the story.</p>



<p>“I can tell you on authority that before this became a public issue, the panel had been sitting for weeks and when the panel established some grounds for Mr. Magu to be invited, the President then gave approval for him to be invited and he was invited and he came.”</p>



<p>Adesina said Magu was told to step aside to allow a seamless investigation.</p>

<p>The Presidency on Saturday, July 11, 2020 has said that those who hold the insinuation that the ongoing investigation of the suspended acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, is an indication of the administration’s failing anti-corruption fight have missed the point.</p>



<p>It said rather, the development was a further proof that the fight is real and active.</p>



<p>The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said this in a statement titled “Presidency’s statement on the suspension of Mr Ibrahim Magu.”</p>



<p>This is the first time the Presidency will react officially since Magu’s travails started on Monday when he was arrested and brought before the Justice Ayo Salami-led presidential panel.</p>



<p>The statement read, “Those who see Magu’s investigation, as a signal that the fight against corruption is failing, have unfortunately, missed the boat.</p>



<p><em>“There is no better indication that the fight is real and active than the will to investigate allegations in an open and transparent manner against those who have been charged to be custodians of this very system.</em></p>



<p><em>“Under this President and government, this is our mantra and guiding principle. There are no sacred cows, and for those who think they have a halo over their heads, their days are also numbered.</em></p>



<p><em>“Mr Magu was not immune – and regardless of the obvious embarrassment that potential acts of wrongdoing by him, given the office he held, may appear for the government.</em></p>



<p><em>“No other administration in the history of Nigeria would have moved to bring into the light and public domain such an allegation.”</em> Shehu said.</p>



<p>He said a preliminary review of the allegations levelled against him and several other members of his staff revealed that there were grounds for a detailed investigation to be conducted, heence, an investigative panel was constituted in compliance with the extant laws governing the convening of such a body.</p>



<p>Justifying Magu’s suspension, he added, “<em>As is the proper procedure, when allegations are made against the Chief Executive of an institution, and in this case an institution that ought to be seen as beyond reproach, the Chief Executive has to step down from his post and allow for a transparent and unhindered investigation.</em></p>



<p><em>“The EFCC does not revolve around the personality of an individual, and as such cannot be seen through the prism of any individual.</em></p>



<p><em>“Therefore, the suspension of Mr Ibrahim Magu, allows the institution to continue carrying out its mandate without the cloud of investigation hanging over its head.</em></p>



<p>“<em>The EFCC has many good, hardworking men and women who are committed to its ideal and ensuring that the wealth of our country isn’t plundered and wherein there is an act of misappropriation such person(s) are brought to justice.</em></p>



<p><em>“Meanwhile, Magu is being availed the opportunity to defend himself and answer the allegations against him. This is how it should be, as is the fact that under the Laws of Nigeria every citizen is presumed and remains innocent until proven guilty.</em></p>



<p><em>“We must realise that the fight against corruption is not a static event, but a dynamic and ever evolving process, in which the EFCC is just one actor; and as we continue to work towards improving our democratic process so shall every institution of ours also embark on that journey of evolution.</em></p>



<p><em>“What is however important is that there must be accountability and transparency and our people must realize that they would be held to account. This is the building block in the fight against corruption, the establishment of the concept of Accountability and the recognition of the Rule of Law.”</em></p>

<p>His house in Karu, Abuja has been searched, with his wife following them from room to room to ensure nothing incriminating was planted and they found nothing.</p>



<p>On that 7-man panel, the Attorney-General has two reps, one for the Justice ministry and the other for the office of the AGF. The NFIU and the DSS do not like Magu and they have a rep each on the panel. Remember the nasty letter of indictment which the DSS wrote. That is 4- 3 already, minus the police. The police rep won&#8217;t support Magu because the IG reportedly once accused him of not attending police meetings.The police have even detained him without an order of the court and up till now, against the provisions of the law, he has not been bailed. That&#8217;s 5-2.&#8221;</p>
