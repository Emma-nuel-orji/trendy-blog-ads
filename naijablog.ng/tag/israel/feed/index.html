<p>A Turkish opposition legislator has died, two days after he suffered a heart attack and collapsed in front of parliament.</p>



<p>Hasan Bitmez, a member of parliament from the opposition Felicity (Saadet) Party, died in Ankara City Hospital, on Thursday, December 14, according to Health Minister Fahrettin Koca.</p>



<p>The 54-year-old father of one slumped on Tuesday, December 12, moments after he finished a speech criticising the government’s policy toward Israel.</p>



<p>“You allow ships to go to Israel, and you shamelessly call it trade. … You are Israel’s accomplice,” Bitmez said in his speech targeting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AK Party) on Tuesday after placing a poster on the podium reading: “Murderer Israel; collaborator AKP.”</p>



<p>“Even if you escape the torm£nt of history, you will not be able to escape the wrath of God,” he said at the end of the 20-minute speech before collapsing at the lectern.</p>

<p>The United Nation (UN) has condemned Israel for there action in demolishing an entire Palestinian Bedouin village.</p>



<p>The demolition leave over 70 people homeless.</p>



<p>Israel has displaced 869 Palestinians in 2020 and is threatening to destroy over 50 schools.</p>



<p>The say it took the action because most of them are not having Israeli permits, which it &#8220;almost never&#8221; gives Palestinians. </p>

<article id="mainContent" class=" _1E94O cb-pd-l--lg cb-pd-r--lg cb-pd-b--md G-can-be-select">As with much diplomacy, projection is often the thing that matters most. The announcement by<a style="line-height: 1.5" type="anchor"> Donald Trump </a><span style="line-height: 1.5">that the US has helped broker a deal that involves the &#8220;full normalisation&#8221; of ties between the United Arab Emirates and</span><a style="line-height: 1.5" type="anchor"> Israel </a><span style="line-height: 1.5">falls into this category.</span></p>
<div><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48494" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Trump.jpg?resize=320%2C213&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="320" height="213" data-recalc-dims="1" /></div>
<p>That is not to say it isn&#8217;t historic if the deal is as advertised. Jordan was the last Arab nation to accept ties with Israel, back in 1994. And before that, only Egypt made a peace deal with Israel &#8211; in 1979. Mauritania recognised Israel in 1999, but later ended relations in 2009 over the conflict in Gaza at the time.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_67168" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67168" style="width: 252px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-67168" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_15973899319468062-252x315.jpg?resize=252%2C315&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="252" height="315" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-67168" class="wp-caption-text">Joint agreement between the United States of America, UAE and Israel State,</figcaption></figure></p>
<div></div>
<p>So, it is a diplomatic boost for Trump before a presidential election in November that is looking increasingly tough, against an opponent in Joe Biden that has had his fair share of foreign policy experience as vice president to Barack Obama. It is also a fillip for Trump&#8217;s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who had been placed in charge of the Middle East brief and whose plans for peace in the region have raised the hackles of a number of Arab nations.</p>
<p>Israel&#8217;s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu will also also welcome a diplomatic win in conjunction with his long-term ally in Washington. Israel&#8217;s country&#8217;s coalition government, formed after a number of failed elections, is not the most stable and Netanyahu himself has faced falling popularity over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<div></div>
<p>For the <a style="line-height: 1.5" type="anchor">UAE</a><span style="line-height: 1.5">, the deal allows them to make a splash on the international stage amid an increasingly fraught situation in the Middle East. Allied to the US, there appears little doubt that allowing Trump to announce the deal will strengthen ties there.</span></p>
