<p>The ban was disclosed by the commissioner of information Muhammad Garba at a joint press conference in Kano.</p>



<p>“Eid prayers would be carried out with strict compliance to the laid down protocols, all the Emirs of the four Emirate Councils of Gaya, Karaye, Bichi and Rano will carry out the prayers at their councils,” Garba said.</p>



<p>Garba stated that the government will assign officials to monitor activities in the five emirate councils to ensure compliance by all.</p>



<p>Similarly in Jigawa State, governor Badaru Abubakar on Tuesday banned all Eid-el-Kabir celebrations to prevent further spread of the global pandemic.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/images-19-3.jpeg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-61861" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Mohammed Badaru Abubakar, Gov Jigawa State</figcaption></figure>



<p>Abubakar also stopped the five first-class Emirs from leading any traditional horse durbar during the celebration.</p>



<p>He said that Jigawa State was winning the fight against the virus as no new cases have been recorded for over 30 days.</p>



<p>“Despite this development, the state will remain strong in the fight against the disease in order to maintain and improve in controlling the pandemic,” Abubakar said.</p>



<p>The 2020 Eid-el-Kabir celebration holds Friday, July 31 and Monday, August 1.</p>
