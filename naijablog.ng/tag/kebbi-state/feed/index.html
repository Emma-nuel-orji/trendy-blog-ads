<p>The government of Kebbi State has discharged the last two COVID-19 patients in its isolation centre after their recovery.</p>
<p>This was made known by the Task Force Chairman on COVID-19, who is also the Commissioner for Health, Jafar Muhammed. He stated that the follow up tests conducted on them came back negative.</p>
<p>He said that with the latest discharge, the state no longer had any active case of COVID-19.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our two remaining COVID-19 patients at the isolation center in Kebbi Medical Center, Kalgo, are discharged today.</p>
<p>So, by implication, they are free to be integrated back into the mainstream society because their results turned out to be negative after their two weeks stay in the isolation centre,&#8221; Muhammed said.</p>
<p>Kebbi State recorded 32 cases of persons infected with Coronavirus.</p>
