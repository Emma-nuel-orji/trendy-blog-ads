<p>Adedeji Doherty, immediate past Chairman, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Lagos State, says the party now has grassroots structure and state executive to win the 2023 elections.</p>



<p>Doherty said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Lagos.</p>



<p>He said that lack of structure at the grassroots and candidate imposition had resulted in the failure of the party in previous elections.</p>



<p>According to him, the Feb. 27 Elective State Congress of the party remains a watershed for the party to recruit executive members bent on nothing but winning elections in the state.</p>



<p>“After serving as chairman in Lagos state, I can categorically say that disunity is not the problem of PDP winning election in the state but non existence of structures at the grassroots level, which has now been created in the last state congress.</p>



<p>“We have between 500,000 and 600,000 registered people now as members of PDP in Lagos.</p>



<p>“We lost elections because we don’t have the structure; if you don’t have the structure, you cannot spend money in the right place.</p>



<p>“The structure is already on ground to win election. We are working now. We are galvanising people and everybody has to be onboard,” Doherty said.</p>



<p>He said that imposition and selection had been the major setback for PDP, adding that they always created divisions and disunity in the party.</p>

<p>The Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has approved free rides on Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridors on Christmas and New Year days for all residents on Saturday, 25th December, 2021 and Saturday, 1st of January, 2022, in celebration of the festive season.</p>



<p>A statement signed by the Managing Director, Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA), Engr. (Mrs.) Abimbola Akinajo, said the free commuter bus services are being offered to Lagosians in the spirit of joy, love and peace which the festive season signifies.</p>



<p>According to her, the Sanwo-Olu led administration is committed to ensuring the execution of the Strategic Transport Master Plan via the Multimodal Transport System currently taking shape through water transportation and the ongoing Blue and Red Lines rail projects.</p>



<p>“The Governor has given his promise for the commencement of passenger operations on the first two phases of the State’s rail lines &#8211; Blue and Red. He has demonstrated his commitment to the completion of both rail lines by sourcing funds for their completion and provision of rolling stock. What is therefore expected of Lagosians is to support him towards the realisation of the Greater Lagos vision”, Mrs. Akinajo stated.</p>



<p>The Managing Director expressed the Lagos State Government&#8217;s gratitude for the patience and perseverance the citizenry has shown in the face of the discomfort accompanied with the construction of transport infrastructure, assuring that consistent and spirited efforts are being made to improve public transport and traffic management.</p>



<p>While extending yuletide compliments to all Lagosians, Mrs. Akinajo enjoined everyone to observe all extant COVID-19 safety rules and travel safely during the festive period.</p>

<p>Tragedy heat Lagos State on Tuesday after moving truck failed brake and ran into school children killing at least 13.</p>



<p>Naijablog learnt that the truck driver ran into the children just outside Ojodu Grammar School and sped away.</p>



<p>The report has it that the truck suffered a brake failure and rammed into them, 13 has been confirmed dead, but there may be more casualties, because exact number has not been confirmed as the time of filing this report.</p>



<p>The children were returning from school when the incident happened.</p>



<p>The accident happened along Isheri Road, just before the Ojodu <strong>Police Station.</strong></p>



<p>Businesses along the road have shut down while vehicular traffic is grounded.</p>



<p>Witnesses said the truck driver ran into the children just outside Ojodu Grammar School and sped away.</p>



<p>“He was pursued and caught around Ogba and was brought back to the station. That is why the youth are attacking the police station.”</p>



<p>Adekunle Ajisebutu, the police spokesperson in Lagos, said the casualty figure is yet to be confirmed.</p>



<p>“We are on top of the situation,” said Mr Ajisebutu, a chief superintendent of police.</p>



<p>“Adequate policemen are on ground to maintain law and order. The situation is being professionally handled.”</p>



<p>As of the time of filing this report, angry youth had vandalised trucks around the area and were throwing stones into the police station.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, police officers have barricaded their gates and are firing gunshots and tear gas canisters at intervals from inside the station.</p>

<p>The First Lady of Lagos State, Dr. (Mrs.) Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, has reiterated the commitment of the State government to the welfare and wellbeing of people with disabilities, stressing that the present administration is determined to ensure Persons Living With Disabilities (PLWDs) achieve their full potentials in life.</p>



<p>Speaking at a ceremony held to commemorate the Y2021 International Day of Persons with Disabilities at the Police College Parade Ground, Ikeja, Lagos, Dr. (Mrs.) Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu stated that global consensus does not regard physical disability as an inability and, therefore, it should not incapacitate anyone from achieving something positive in life.</p>



<p>Dr. Sanwo-Olu, represented by Mrs. Rhoda Ayinde, maintained that all persons with physical disabilities have special skills and talents, hence the present administration has provided an enabling environment for PLWDs to achieve their goals in all spheres of human endeavour.</p>



<p>Noting that the theme of the Y2021 celebration is “Leadership and Participation of Persons with Disabilities towards an Inclusive, Accessible and Sustainable Post COVID-19 World”, Mrs. Sanwo-Olu said that the emergence of the Omicron variant of the virus makes it essential to adopt all-inclusive strategies that would ensure persons living with disabilities are also protected from its effects.</p>



<p>Her words: “It is our collective duty as a people to promote and integrate them to be part of the larger society, we must eschew all practices that tend to segregate people at all levels”.</p>



<p>She commended the Ministry of Education for its tremendous contributions to enhancing the skills and confidence of persons with disabilities and putting their welfare on the front burner.</p>



<p>Earlier in his welcome address, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Mr. Abolaji Abayomi, said the celebration was aimed at promoting an understanding of disability issues while mobilising support for respect of the dignity, rights and wellbeing of persons with disabilities.</p>



<p>Abayomi appreciated the additional efforts of all Special Teachers, Caregivers and Support Staff in all the Special Schools and Inclusive Units across the State for the services being rendered to humanity.</p>



<p>The Permanent Secretary also encouraged the children to pursue their aspirations for excellence, just as he advised the parents with special children to enrol them in special schools as they all have bright futures and potentials to excel.</p>

<p>Lagos Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s representative at the annual music concert, #TheExperience2021 was booed by the congregation.</p>



<p>The representative had come with a message from the governor but he was jeered at as he delivered his message.</p>



<p>This prompted the Senior Pastor of the House On The Rock Church, Pastor Paul Adefarasin to caution the congregation while admonishing them to “learn to pray for those who lead us that we may dwell peaceably in the land that they live.”</p>



<p>He also apologized to the “leaders of Lagos State” on behalf of the people.</p>



<p>Reactions have trailed both the booing and the apology.</p>

<p>The Founder and Spiritual Leader of the Love of Christ Generation Church, C&amp;S, Rev. Mother Esther Ajayi has said Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu is working to make Lagos State a better place to live.</p>



<p>Rev. Mother Ajayi stated this after receiving an Outstanding Philanthropist Award from the Lagos State Council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, at the Gala/Awards Night held at the Lagos Airport Hotel, Ikeja as part of activities to mark the Union&#8217;s annual Press Week.</p>



<p>According to the Spiritual Leader, &#8220;what is happening in Lagos State now, what Mr. Governor is doing is amazing. Sometimes, you might not see it if you don&#8217;t pay attention to it; some roads were completed and when my church was opened in Victoria Island, everything went hitch-free.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I am not saying we are there yet but amazing things are happening in Lagos right now and I want us to keep looking at that side&#8221;, she said.</p>



<p>Ajayi, who revealed that her parents were from Lagos State, expressed her belief that &#8220;Nigeria is God&#8217;s own country and Lagos State is where Jesus Christ dwells&#8221;.</p>

<p>As part of efforts to bridge the communication gap and strengthen the relationship between law enforcement personnel and young people in the State, the Lagos State Government has organised an interactive forum for Police Officers and Youths.</p>



<p>Speaking at the forum with the theme: “Strengthening Police and Youth Relationship in Lagos State”, the State Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Mr. Olusegun Dawodu, said the programme became necessary following the noticeable discord between both groups.</p>



<p>He explained that the interactive session was organised to mend the mistrust between the police and youths and restore confidence among these important groups in society.</p>



<p>Dawodu said: “Most young people have oftentimes complained of having been denied their basic rights such as the right to live, freedom of movement, speech, association and expression by the actions of the law enforcement agents, especially Police Officers”.</p>



<p>He also explained that young people are sometimes labelled troublemakers when their strength and energy are not channelled to positive use, hence, making the law enforcement officers often see young people as a problem to be solved.</p>



<p>Describing the youths as very pivotal to achieving the Greater Lagos vision, the Commissioner stressed that the Police Force is one of the critical bedrocks in the community for ensuring that lives and property of the citizens are protected from dubious and criminally-minded individuals.</p>



<p>He emphasised that there is a need for cordial and long-lasting relationships between both parties to ensure a crime-free Lagos, where youths can also contribute their quota to the development of the State and country without any form of molestation or harassment.</p>



<p>Dawodu, however, stressed that young people in the state have a collective responsibility to obey and uphold law and order by shunning crime and violence in all forms while imploring both parties to build a better understanding and strengthen their relationship towards the development of Lagos State.</p>



<p>Earlier, the Permanent Secretary for Youth and Social Development, Dr. Olugbemiga Aina, noted that the gathering was an opportunity for the youths and police to discuss their differences and grievances amicably for an improved security situation and prevention of future face-off.</p>



<p>Dr. Aina, represented by the Director of Youth, Mr. Olufemi Adetoye, stated further that the platform will avail the Police Command the opportunity to explain its operations and principles to the youths, enlighten them on what constitutes criminality, establish an effective communication channel and clear all doubts about its integrity and effectiveness.</p>



<p>In his remark, the Commissioner for Police, Hakeem Odumosu, disclosed that the Police Force has continued to organise various training and workshops to upskill officers in order to discharge their duties diligently, as well as interact better with members of the public.</p>



<p>He pointed out that the Force has always been engaging the youths through social media interaction, while also sensitising them on the need to be security conscious as part of efforts to create a better relationship with the citizens and ensure a crime-free environment.</p>



<p>The Guest Speaker and Team Lead of Edgeforth Business Solutions, Mr. Sheriff Adekoya, advised the Police to intensify communal engagement and collaborate with influential youths in neighbourhoods as part of measures to effectively discharge their duties.</p>



<p>He also urged youths to be empathetic, super friendly, intelligent, respectful and well-dressed, while avoiding subjective sentiments during their interactions with the men and women of the Nigeria Police Force.</p>



<p>Other discussants at the forum, including members of the Lagos Police Command and influential youths in the State, advised that both parties should have respect for each other and relate with mutual trust.</p>
