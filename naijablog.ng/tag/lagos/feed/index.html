As Africa&#8217;s largest city by population and one of its fastest-growing economies, Lagos offers a compelling and profitable environment for investment across various sectors. </p>



<p>10&nbsp; crucial insights to consider when exploring investment opportunities in this bustling metropolis</p>



<p>1. Sustained robust Economic Growth:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lagos boasts a robust economy, contributing significantly to Nigeria&#8217;s GDP. With diverse sectors such as finance, technology, manufacturing, and entertainment driving its growth, the city offers a fertile ground for investors seeking high returns on their investments.</p>



<p>2. Strategic Location for Investment:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Situated along the Atlantic Ocean coast, Lagos serves as a gateway to regional and international markets. Its strategic location facilitates trade and commerce, making it an attractive destination for businesses looking to expand their reach across West Africa and beyond.</p>



<p>3. Constant Booming Population:&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a population exceeding 20 million people, Lagos presents a vast consumer market hungry for goods and services.

<p>4. Permanent Infrastructure Development:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite facing infrastructural challenges, Lagos is undergoing significant development initiatives aimed at enhancing its transportation networks, power supply, and urban amenities. Investments in infrastructure projects present lucrative opportunities for investors looking to contribute to the city&#8217;s growth and development.

Its rich cultural heritage, vibrant arts scene, and dynamic nightlife contribute to its allure as a destination for leisure and entertainment investments, including hospitality, tourism, and events management.</p>



<p>9. Resilience and Adaptability:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite facing occasional challenges such as infrastructure deficits, security concerns, and bureaucratic bottlenecks, Lagos has demonstrated resilience and adaptability in navigating these obstacles. Investors can leverage the city&#8217;s entrepreneurial spirit and ingenuity to mitigate risks and capitalize on emerging opportunities.</p>

<p>A 22-year-old lady, Fasia Ajoke, was on Thursday sentenced to seven months and three weeks in prison by the Special Offences Court at Bolade-Oshodi for assaulting a Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps female officer while on duty.</p>



<p>The state Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Tokunbo Wahab, disclosed this in a post on his X handle on Thursday.</p>



<p>Wahab said Ajoke was also guilty of resisting arrest and refusing to use the pedestrian bridge.</p>



<p>His post read, &#8220;The Special Offences Court at Bolade-Oshodi today convicted a lady, 22-year-old Fasia Ajoke to seven months and three weeks in jail for assaulting a female operative of the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps (KAI) #LAGESCOfficial on lawful duty, resisting lawful arrest and refusing to make use of the Ile-Epo pedestrian bridge, thereby endangering her life in the process.</p>



<p>&#8220;She was arraigned before Chief Magistrate S.A Adefioye of the Lagos State Special Offences (Mobile Court), Bolade-Oshodi on offences bordering on conducting herself in a manner likely to breach peace, obstruction and breach of peace by crossing the highway.&#8221;</p>



<p>The commissioner urged residents to desist from assaulting environmental officers and to prioritise using pedestrian bridges.</p>



<p>He wrote, &#8220;We enjoin every well-meaning Lagosians to desist from assaulting our environmental officers and also make use of the pedestrian bridges as the state will not hesitate to prosecute anyone found breaking the law.&#8221;</p>



<p>The PUNCH reported on Tuesday that the Lagos State Government arrested seven miscreants for allegedly assaulting environmental officials during the removal of shanties and illegal structures along the Jakande Estate in the state.</p>



<p>It had also reported in February that the government described the crossing of major highways in the state by pedestrians as an offence adding that any defaulter caught will be prosecuted.</p>

<p>Emotions were let loosed on Thursday when a widow, 49, Eorothy Dike and her son, Osinachi Ndukwe, wept openly as they begged for price reduction while their only vehicle bought at the rate of N1.8.million on hired purchase was being auctioned for N450,000.</p>

<p>“I bought the bus at N1.8 million on hired purchase in 2021 and was plying Ijegun enroute Cele Expressway.</p>



<p>“The bus was three months old and I had remitted N300,000 when I drove against traffic in Cele area and the bus was impounded.</p>



<p>“Not only that, I was sentenced to three years imprisonment which I completed recently but before the completion, information reached me that my three years old daughter was ill due to lack of fund and before I completed the jail term, I got information that she had died.</p>



<p>“I am here with my mother with the expectation that we will buy the bus at the rate of N50,000. Surprisingly, the price was closed at N450,000 and we have 48 hours to complete the payment</p>



<p>“We have sold most of our belongings to feed and are left with nothing. This is a great problem before us. My father died while I was three years old and my mother has been there for me but there is no way she can raise N450,000.</p>



<p>“Who will I turn to at a time many Nigerians are finding it difficult to feed? I don’t know what to do again,”</p>

<p>Our attention has been drawn to the wild allegations made by the People’s Democratic Party Governorship Candidate in Lagos, Mr. Olajide Adediran, during an Arise TV interview. He accused the Lagos State Signage and Advertisement Agency (LASAA) of removing his campaign posters and instructing outdoor advertising agencies from not to fly his campaign materials.</p>



<p>Mr. Adediran claimed that the Lagos State Government instructed outdoor advertising practitioners to reject materials from opposition parties and, therefore, his advertisement materials were brought down midway into a contract.</p>



<p>The PDP candidate displayed stark ignorance of the rules guiding outdoor advertisement practice in Lagos. LASAA simply regulates billboard structures and not advertisement campaigns.</p>



<p>The decision to deploy any advertisement is the sole discretion of billboard owners who must have registered with LASAA for a licence to hoist advertisement structures in the State. Advertising companies determine their clients and the terms of their trade.</p>



<p>LASAA will remain steadfast and committed to its responsibility and the dictates of the law without being partisan.</p>



<p>For the avoidance of doubt, indiscriminate pasting of posters will not be permitted anywhere in Lagos until political campaigns have been formally flagged off, in accordance with INEC guidelines. Even at that, it must be done at designated sites.</p>



<p>The guidelines will be enforced without prejudice against any political party, association or aspirant.</p>



<p>Lagosians will not be distracted by any political party or candidate who tends to whip up sentiments to gain public sympathy.</p>

<p>The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in Lagos State, Dr Olajide Adediran, has accused the state government of frustrating his campaign efforts.</p>



<p>During an interview on Arise TV on Wednesday, Adediran aka Jandor claimed that billboard companies are refunding his money and saying they have been asked not to any advertising from him.</p>



<p>He said, “The moment that of Afromedia happened in Falomo here, I placed a call through to the Lagos police commissioner myself and I said to him, ‘CP, this just happened. It was removed.’ We didn’t even know, we thought it was the hoodlums who removed. It was after investigation that we realised that it was the state government, through LASAA that removed it. The company in question did say to us, ‘They have asked us not to take anything from you. We will refund your money.” Just like JCDecaux did refund our money.</p>



<p>“We will continue to paste our posters. Last week on the Third Mainland bridge, which is even a Federal Government road, our people put some A4 boards. They were removing it in broad day light. After paying for all of these. We won’t allow this, we will find a way to put our campaign materials out there.”</p>

<p>A Yaba Chief Magistrate’s Court in Lagos State, on Monday, granted bail in the sum of one million Naira to the Lagos Island Branch B chairman of National Union of Road Transport Workers, (NURTW) charged with murder.</p>



<p>The NURTW Chairman, Azeez Lawal (a.k.a Kunle Poly), is charged along with one Adekanbi Wahab, 38.</p>



<p>Chief Magistrate Linda Balogun said on Monday that Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP) advised that a prima facie case had been established against the defendants.</p>



<p>According to Balogun, Lawal, aged 48, is to be tried for accessory after the fact to murder while Wahab will face trial for membership of an unlawful society.</p>



<p>She added that the DPP advised that three other defendants, whose names were mentioned in the advice though they were charged separately from the two defendants, should be discharged.</p>



<p>She transferred the case to a high court.</p>



<p>A lawyer from the DPP, Mrs O. R. Saliu, had told the court that the legal advice was ready and in the court’s file.</p>



<p>Following an application by counsel to both defendants, Mr Adeshina Okulana, who told the court that the defendants had been in custody for 78 days, the chief magistrate granted each of them one million Naira bail.</p>



<p>Balogun also ordered that the defendants should produce two sureties each as part of the bail condition.</p>



<p>She held that one of the sureties must be a traditional ruler or religious leader, adding that both sureties must reside within the court’s jurisdiction.</p>



<p>She held that a self-employed person would not stand as the surety, adding that any civil servant wishing to stand as the surety must get a letter from the Head of Service of Lagos State.</p>



<p>Balogun adjourned the case until May 11 for report on filing of the case at a high court.</p>



<p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit murder, murder and membership of an unlawful society.</p>



<p>They were remanded for an initial period of 30 days on Jan. 27 and another 30 days on Feb. 28.</p>



<p>Balogun earlier remanded the defendants at the Police Zonal Monitoring Unit, Zone 2 Headquarters, Onikan, and subsequently, at Ikoyi Custodial Centre.</p>



<p>The alleged offences contravene Section 233 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015, and Section 3 of the Anti-cultism Law of Lagos State, 2021.</p>
