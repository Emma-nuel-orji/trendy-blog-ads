<p>The affected tenant, Ifeanyichukwu Eluu, who&#8217;s a Pastor shared his experience online. He wrote:</p>



<p>“The last experience I had, getting an apartment in Anambra state wasn&#8217;t a good one. I had paid 100% for the apartment to the caretaker, preparing to settle in after signing the necessary tenancy agreement the following day.</p>



<p>&#8220;But there was a reconsideration afterwards, we had stayed for a longer time in a hotel. So, we needed to quickly move into the property, of which we informed the caretaker about the move. We rushed to get the basic things to equip the house right away and the same evening, we moved into the house.</p>



<p>&#8220;Around 12 midnight, I saw an alert of the exact Money I paid to the caretaker. I called him right away, he said the landlord refunded the Money when he heard we&#8217;re from Ebonyi state,&#8221; Abakaliki&#8221; as generally refered.</p>



<p>&#8220;I felt so insulted, embarrassed, as well, very concerned at such level of discrimination against fellow brothers.</p>



<p>&#8220;The last place I finally got a house, the Man asked where I&#8217;m from, I told him &#8220;Afikpo&#8221;. Then he said, okay, I know Afikpo, they are partly Abia state, I can consider you, that&#8217;s how we settled. But I wasn&#8217;t happy that I had to route through such bias just to get a house to live in</p>



<p>&#8220;Please, let the concerned handlers review this in time, hence the maxim &#8220;Igbo bu ofu&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Adeosun/Idi Orogbo Community in Ido Local Government Area of Oyo State was thrown into shock on Sunday when they found of one of their landlords, Mr John Aderemi Abiola, in his room, almost four years after he was last seen in December 2018.</p>
<p>The discovery was made after the community decided, with the approval of the police authorities, to go into his compound to clear the bush in his compound which had overgrown his fence into the next house, causing invasion by reptiles.</p>
<p>As 2019 crept into 2020, the residents started wondering where the man could be. Though he told about two of those he used to communicate with of his intention to go to Port Harcourt, Rivers State, and be back for Ileya ceremony in 2018, not seeing him for the festivity and thereafter made them to think he was staying back where he initially came from.</p>
<p>Nigerian Tribune reports that calls to his phone lines were not going through other. After it was noticed that the weeds in his compound had grown bushy, the community landlords were said to have decided in a meeting to find a means of getting access to the premises to clear the bush.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/FB_IMG_1662735178917.jpg?resize=678%2C678&#038;ssl=1" class="wp-image-123894 alignnone size-full" width="678" height="678"  data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>From then to 2021, till 2022 is getting to the end, the residents of the community who did not know his whereabouts decided again to go and clear the bush. It is reported that laborers who went to clear the bush noticed that the window of Mr Abiola’s room was open, and his Volkswagen car was covered in bush which prompted curiosity.</p>
<p>One of the landlords, Mr Mohammed Ademola, who also worked for and used to interact with Mr Abiola, decided to check what was in the room. He was however shocked when he saw the skeleton on the bed of the house owner.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/FB_IMG_1662735189592.jpg?resize=678%2C678&#038;ssl=1" class="wp-image-123893 alignnone size-full" width="678" height="678"  data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>The eyewitnesses decided not to tamper with his remains because the community didn’t want to risk anything. They were told by security personnel to slow the environmental authorities handle the matter. Mr. Ademola noted that the deceased was not known with any of his family members and it was difficult to trace his family.</p>

<p>My Landlord burnt down my pharmacy yesterday the 1st of February 2022!!!!</p>



<p>.. I’m broken and shattered</p>



<p>,I need help !! Sometime last month, my landlord came to my pharmacy accusing i and my wife of entering his house to poison his water tank (the same water we use</p>



<p>in the pharmacy), his tea cup, spoons, his gate, his keys, his pillow and other house appliances (video evidence). We challenged him radically and chased him back into his apartment. We called our lawyer to report the ugly incident but he advised we stay calm and watch him</p>



<p>If any further attack then we can take it up. I rushed to Ogombo police station to make entry. The police immediately mobilized a team to go with me. The DPO of Ogombo police station was immediately alerted to give the signal to his boys but he asked them to disembark from</p>



<p>he called me in and explained his encounter with this same landlord of mine. He told me how my landlord came to the police station 2 years ago to accuse someone of poisoning his water , tea cup and other home appliances . The DPO said that he moved with his boys immediately</p>



<p>to the scene to do their duty, after which he told my landlord that there is no trace of poisoning or such but if he is not satisfied he can take the water sample to Nafdac DPO said this man fulstrated him, dragged him to alausa for no reason. So he won’t be able to handle his case, that I should please report to a higher police station . After 3 days, on a Friday I was in my office when a petition was delivered to me from Area A police station, Lagos island to report on Monday . We also informed our lawyer and he asked us to get set by Monday.</p>



<p>We also informed our lawyer and he asked us to get set by Monday. I, my wife and our Lawyer appeared at area A on Monday and was given the petition to read. It was this same landlord of ours, he said we are known armed rubbers, we gain entrance to his house and poisoned all his things and the police should evict us immediately from his property. Meanwhile, because it’s in a good location, we rented the abandoned and dilapidated shop space for 1.5m and for 2 yrs(3m for 2 yrs). 10% each for agent, agreement and caution fee.</p>



<p>We renovated the whole building and fixed it to fit in for a pharmacy and Aesthetics clinic with over 3m (every dime spent on repairs with receipt) . The inspector in charge of the case came to his house on Friday last week to interrogate and she took all the items he (the landlord) said was poisoned. He kept forcing the police to eject us but the police said he should refund all the money we paid him in full and this man said he doesn’t have such money but the police should just eject us and kept pressing on this.</p>



<p>We were supposed to meet at area A on Monday but I didn’t because wifey wasn’t strong. This man went there to cause trouble and was violent accusing them of taking side with us. Our lawyer petitioned him and transferred the case to state CID panti.</p>



<p>The petition was signed on Monday. And on Tuesday, Feb 1st at about 1am wifey got a call from a Neigbour crying that our pharmacy is on fire. We rush down to our pharmacy, the whole community was already outside trying to put off the fire but to no avail</p>



<p>Called Fire service over and over and they finally appeared when everything has been burnt down</p>



<p>This man was inside his house and locked himself up all through his car parked inside his compound . Ogombo Police patrol team came to the scene, opened and</p>



<p>entered his apartment, banged on his doors severally but he refused to open up .. Mr John Okechukwu Nwaimo incinerated my pharmacy</p>
