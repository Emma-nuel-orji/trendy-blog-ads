<p>A lovely couple from Nebraska, US, are celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary, and they wore their original wedding outfits. How cute!</p>
<p>The lovebirds, Marvin and Lucille marked the milestone with this beautiful photoshoot. The wedding dress was made by Lucille in 1960.</p>
<p>Looking back at their wedding day, Lucille said,</p>
<p>&#8220;My dad cried. He was the only one that cried. My mother beamed and they both thought Marvin was just perfect, and that does help when your parents like the person that you’re marrying.”</p>
<p>Katie Aurty, the photographer who shared the photos on social media said,</p>
<p>“What an amazing example these two are of true love standing the test of time. I am so glad to have met them, and honoured to have captured these memories for them.”</p>

<p>Former Pope, Benedict XVI is seriously ill with shingles according to a report in the Monday, August 3, 2020 edition of the German Passauer Neue Presse newspaper.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot_20200803-133757-402x630.png?resize=402%2C630&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-64480" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Pope Emeritus, Benedict XVI</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Shingles is a viral infection that causes a painful rash.</p>



<p>According to the report the Pope, now 93, is very frail and his voice is barely audible as the infection is causing episodes of severe pain</p>



<p>He became seriously ill after returning to the Vatican from a visit to Germany in June where he went to see his dying brother.</p>



<p>The pope is suffering from a virus that causes a facial rash and episodes of severe pain, the newspaper reported, citing the former pope&#8217;s biographer Peter Seewald.</p>



<p>According to Peter Seewald, the former pope&#8217;s biographer:</p>



<p><em>&#8220;the Pope emeritus is now extremely frail,&#8221; the report says. &#8220;His thinking and his memory are quick, but his voice is hardly audible at the moment.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Seewald visited Benedict in Rome on Saturday August 1, 2020 to present him with his biography.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;At the meeting the emeritus Pope, despite his illness, was optimistic and declared that if his strength increased again he would possibly take up his pen again,&#8221;</em> the paper said.</p>



<p>Georg Ratzinger, brother to Benedict, and aged 96, died shortly after he was visited by the former pope. It was Benedict&#8217;s first trip outside Italy since 2013, the year he resigned the papacy, citing a &#8220;lack of strength of mind and body&#8221; connected to his old age.</p>



<p>Pope Benedict, whose original name is Joseph Ratzinger, now lives in a small former monastery inside the Vatican and is being cared for daily by a team of doctors.</p>

<p>Microsoft is in talks to acquire TikTok, the immensely popular social media app known for its fun short-form videos, in a move that could prevent the Trump administration from banning it from the US, according to reports.</p>



<p>The Seattle tech giant founded by Bill Gates is in discussions to buy TikTok in a deal valued in the tens of billions, according to Fox Business. </p>



<p>The acquisition talks come as TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, has come under intense scrutiny by public officials concerned that the Chinese government is using the app to tap user data.</p>



<p>News of the talks come as Trump confirms that he’s looking at taking steps to ban the app in the US a move that Bloomberg reported could happen as soon as Friday.</p>



<p>“We’re looking at TikTok,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. “There are a couple of options but a lot of things are happening, so we’ll see what happens. But we are looking at a lot of alternatives with respect to TikTok.”</p>



<p>An acquisition would instantly turn Microsoft a hot tech name in the 1990s that is now primarily fueled by its massive cloud computing arm into one of the biggest names in social media.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">UAE&#8217;s first nuclear reactor at the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant has successfully started operations.</h3>



<p>The United Arab Emirates has become the first Arabian country to produce nuclear energy, following the start-up of a newly constructed nuclear power plant in Abu Dhabi.</p>



<p>The Barakah Nuclear Power Plant’s Unit 1 is now using nuclear fuel to produce energy after the facility successfully executed initial tests on Saturday. </p>



<p>Three other reactors are still under construction and the plant still needs to be connected to the country’s power grid, local media reported.</p>



<p><em>“Today we announce the UAE’s success in operating the first peaceful nuclear reactor in the Arab world,” </em>Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, ruler of Dubai, wrote on Twitter. </p>



<p>He added that “<em>the goal is to operate four nuclear power plants that will provide one-quarter of the country’s energy needs in a safe, reliable and emission-free way.”</em></p>



<p>Hamad Alkaabi, the UAE’s representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), described the plant’s initial launch as a “historic milestone” for his country. </p>



<p>The Dubai leader also said the plant’s launch illustrates that “the Arabs are able to resume their scientific ambitions” and hinted that the next step for the UAE is space exploration.</p>

<p>As the Edo governorship election day nears, appointees of Governor Godwin Obaseki have continued to resign on a weekly basis.</p>



<p>Many of those who dumped the governor are said to be staunch members of the All Progressives Congress (APC).</p>



<p>The number of resigned appointees has reached 42 and there are speculations that more will tender their resignation.</p>



<p>The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had fixed September 19 for the poll.</p>



<p>The governor defected when the APC disqualified him from participating in the primary.</p>



<p>Osagie Ize-Iyamu, the PDP candidate in 2016, emerged the APC flagbearer.</p>



<p>Obaseki, the APC candidate in 2016, had predicted the development.</p>



<p>He explained that his predecessor, Adams Oshiomhole, brought in Ize-Iyamu from the PDP just to settle scores.</p>



<p>Last week, Oshiomhole, ex-APC National Chairman, stated that he made a mistake supporting Obaseki to become Edo helmsman.</p>



<p>Obaseki was the Chairman, Edo State Economic and Strategy Team, when Oshiomhole was governor.</p>



<p>Currently, no fewer than 42 of his appointees have dropped their appointments.</p>



<p>Recent instances include Patrick Iyoha, Director of Obaseki/Shaibu Movement (OSM) and a member of the Waste Management Board.</p>



<p>Three members in the Edo State Oil and Gas Producing Area Development Commission (EDSOGPADEC) Board – Osamwonyi Atu, Emmanuel Odigie, and Rilwanu Oshiomhole, representing Edo-South, Edo-Central, and Edo-North respectively.</p>



<p>Two members, including Gabriel Oiboh, Chairman, State Post Primary Education Board, left too.</p>



<p>Former Chief of Staff, Taiwo Akerele was the first major appointee who resigned.</p>



<p>Paul Ohonbamu, Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, also bade Obaseki farewell.</p>



<p>Below is the full list of the 42 ex-appointees:</p>



<p>Taiwo Akerele – Chief of Staff</p>



<p>John Mayaki – Chief Press Secretary</p>



<p>Paul Ohonbamu – Commissioner</p>



<p>Omua Oni-Okpako – Commissioner</p>



<p>Monday Ogiegor – MD EDSTMA</p>



<p>Christopher Adesotu – Chairman, Vocational and Technical Education Board</p>



<p>Gabriel Oiboh – Chairman, Post Primary Education Board</p>



<p>Osanyemwere Osawe – Member, Post Primary Education Board</p>



<p>Fulani Yakubu Ekpeyoung – SSA</p>



<p>Adeyanju Noah – SSA</p>



<p>Cordelia M. Iyogun – SSA</p>



<p>James Osheku – SSA</p>



<p>Louis Osamuyi Osayande – SSA</p>



<p>Ernest Unuaghon imina – SSA</p>



<p>Prince Lucky Igbinedion – SSA</p>



<p>Chris Oseiwe Oribhabor – SSA</p>



<p>Solomon Okoduwa – SSA</p>



<p>Kennedy Itepu – SSA</p>



<p>Sabbath Egbeyon – SSA</p>



<p>Emike Obazee – SA</p>



<p>Goodluck A. Uyigue – SA</p>



<p>Razaq Rotimi – SA</p>



<p>Olajide Victor Oloruyomi – SA</p>



<p>Smart Bank – SA</p>



<p>Bright Njor – SA</p>



<p>Kingsley Ekueme – SA</p>



<p>Joshua Akhabue – SA</p>



<p>Oladele Ayotope Josiah – SA</p>



<p>Boyi Magdalene – SA</p>



<p>Osarobo Osaro Anthony – SA</p>



<p>Aibangbee Chico – SA</p>



<p>Obayagbona Augustine – SA</p>



<p>Osamwonyi Atu – EDSOGPADEC</p>



<p>Emmanuel Odigie – EDSOGPADEC</p>



<p>Rilwanu Oshiomhole – EDSOGPADEC</p>



<p>Okondoh Patrick Iyoha – OSM Director</p>



<p>Maureen Osaro Ekhoragbon – Vice-Chairman Ovia North-East</p>



<p>Aghedo Oscar – Secretary Ovia North-East</p>



<p>Kehinde Garrick Osemwingie – Secretary, Uhumwonde LGC</p>



<p>Otaniyen Igbinosa – Orhiomwon Supervisor</p>



<p>Martins Ozakpolor – Orhiomwon Supervisor</p>



<p>Vincent Ehibor – Orhiomwon Supervisor</p>



<p>However, Obaseki has boasted that the PDP will win the election by 75 percent.</p>

<p>Nollywood Actress, Ada Ameh has opined that being a feminist doesn’t mean you shouldn’t submit to your husband as she dropped her &#8216;two cents&#8217; on feminism.</p>



<p>She noted that although she is a feminist, she submits to her husband because that is the right thing to do as a woman. </p>



<p>She referenced her stance of submitting to the husband to the Bible because it teaches women to be submissive to their husbands.</p>



<p>She was asked about some regrets she had made in her life and she said she had no regrets in life.</p>



<p>She was engaged in an interview with The Sun and said that:</p>



<p> <em>&#8220;I can never regret having my child at 14. God forbid! The truth is that the ways of God are so different from the ways of man. </em></p>



<p>&#8220;<em>Just imagine me at this age if I am not married and don’t have a child. </em></p>



<p><em>I am not saying marriage is the ultimate but we both know what I am talking about.&#8221;</em></p>
