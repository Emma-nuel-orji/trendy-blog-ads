<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Complete plans to move to the ZLP after governorship primary elections loss to Eyitayo Jegede of the PDP.</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ajayi, who recently decamped from the APC to the PDP and now to the ZLP, will now be expected to challenge his former allies for the governorship position.</h3>



<p>The deputy governor of Ondo State,&nbsp; Ajayi&nbsp; Agboola, is expected to officially announce his move to the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) and will be adopted as the candidate of the party for the October 10 governorship election, multiple sources close to Ajayi.</p>



<p>This was revealed in a confidential statement made available to TodayNG.</p>



<p>Sources also gathered that Ajayi who lost the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ticket to Eyitayo Jegede, has completed plans to join ZLP having met with state and national leaders of the party.</p>



<p>One of those who is said to have endorsed Ajayi is a former governor of the state, Olusegun Mimiko.</p>



<p>Mimiko is the leader of the ZLP in Ondo. He was adopted as the party’s presidential candidate for the 2019 general elections but suspended his presidential candidacy to run for senator in Ondo West. He lost the senatorial election.</p>



<p>Three associates of Ajayi and two of Mimiko confirmed that both parties held a series of meetings, mainly in Abuja, which ended on Wednesday with a resolution that Ajayi will be announced next week as the ZLP candidate.</p>



<p>The officials asked not to be named because they were not authorised to talk to the media and a formal announcement was yet tot be made.</p>



<p><em>“The deputy governor returned from Abuja yesterday (Wednesday), he has made all consultation with leaders of the party and he will unveil his new party before Monday,”</em> an aide who spoke under anonymity disclosed.</p>



<p>Another close associate of Ajayi told newsmen that “it is true that he’s moving to ZLP because the party has existing structure in the state. We want to play on Mimiko’s template and populate it. There’s still room for substitution of names with INEC. The party will just withdraw the name of the person put there as a decoration. We expect the deputy governor to officially announce before next Monday.”</p>



<p>Ajayi’s name would be used to replace that of the governorship candidate of ZLP, Rotimi Benjamin, this newspaper learnt.</p>



<p>When contacted, the Chief Press Secretary to the deputy governor, Tope Okeowo, did not deny nor confirm the development.</p>



<p>The State Chairman of ZLP, Joseph Akinlaja, is yet to respond to enquiries as of the time of filing this report.</p>



<p>Ajayi’s ZLP candidacy is expected to increase to three, the major candidates for the October 10 election.</p>



<p>Although INEC has cleared 17 parties for the election, it was expected to be a two-horse race between Jegede of the PDP and incumbent governor Rotimi Akeredolu of the All Progressives Congress (APC).</p>

<p>A student of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso, has reportedly spent 54 days of detention in police custody for setting up a Twitter parody account of the former President Goodluck Jonathan.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_20200718_013548.jpg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-60776" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>Parody accounts are permitted by Twitter and are often named after prominent individuals but mainly used for comic purposes relative to unfolding issues in the sociopolitical space of their subjects.</p>



<p>According to Punch, Babatunde Olushola was arrested on May 23, 2020 after the former president filed a complaint with Mohammed Adamu, the inspector-general of police, who would later mobilise for his arrest.</p>



<p>Tope Akinyode, a human rights lawyer, was quoted to have said that the policemen obtained information on Olusola’s call log record from a telecommunications service provider.</p>



<p>As his call history linked him to his uncle, who happened to be a pastor in Ogbomoso, operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) made the clergyman invite him for arrest.</p>



<p>Olushola was thereafter taken to Abuja where he was charged for impersonation and contravening the Cybercrime (Prohibition, Prevention, Etc) Act of 2015.</p>



<p><em>“I was informed that it was one of the aides to former President Jonathan that saw the account. Jonathan immediately reported to the IG and that was how investigations began,”</em> Akinyode said.</p>



<p>While calls for Olusola’s release have increased on social media over the past few days, his bail was fixed at N500,000 and a civil servant of not less than level 15 is expected to stand as his surety.</p>



<p><em>“Olusola has no parents and has not been able to meet the bail conditions hence his continued detention. However, we believe he will be out soon,” </em>Akinyode added.</p>



<p>For parody, Twitter’s policy requires that bios clearly indicate the user isn’t affiliated with the subject and that the account name shows the user isn’t the same person as the account’s subject.</p>



<p>On Olusola’s Twitter page, which has now been suspended, the ex-president’s photo can be seen with the name “Goodluck E. Jonathan”.</p>



<p>The user however informed his 46,400 followers that the account was a parody one with his profile reading, “BrezzisLife, not GEJ.”</p>



<p>Olusola was said to have used the account to make inciting comments about Jonathan’s wife, Dame Patience Ebele Jonathan.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The federal government has said that students of its 104 unity schools across the country will not participate in the yearly examination because of the pandemic, urging states and private school owners to follow suit.</h3>



<p>A former federal minister of youth and sports development, has asked the federal government to find ways to improvise how students can write the West African Secondary School Certifcate Examinations (WASSCE) this year even in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>



<p>The federal government has said that students of its 104 unity schools across the country will not participate in the yearly examination because of the pandemic, urging states and private school owners to follow suit.</p>



<p>However, a number of states in southern Nigeria have declared their intention to put measures in place and go on with the examination, while other West African countries are also going ahead.</p>



<p>Abdullahi, who was also Kwara state commissioner for education from 2003 to 2007, told reteirated that the federal government should not abandon the options available.</p>



<p><em>“The best we can do is to find ways to keep life going even in the midst of the pandemic and continue to find creative ways to manoeuvre around it. It is what we are doing with the airlines. It is what we are doing with the markets. It is what we are doing with sundry other sectors that we have allowed to resume even as the pandemic rages still,”</em> he explained.</p>



<p>He said the decision not to participate in the exams will affect over 1.5 million students this year, and this can get complicated if the pandemic continues into next year, meaning the number of affected students will double.</p>



<p>Accprding to Abdullahi; &nbsp;“The Federal Government is understandably afraid of what could happen, God forbid, if it allows people’s children to gather to write the SSCE examination in the midst of the raging pandemic of COVID-19.</p>



<p><em>“When it comes to COVID-19, there is no easy answer, and there will always be trade-off. Federal Government is therefore choosing to err on the side of caution by asking children not to write the examinations.</em></p>



<p><em>“However, the easier or safer options are not necessarily the best. The relative net consequences of all available options have to be considered and weighed against one another. When we consider that this safe option will mean that about 1.5 million children will be left hanging for one year and by next year, this number will double, along with all the implications, then we must force ourselves to think more deeply and begin to consider even more difficult options. No one knows if this pandemic will end next year, or even in the next five years. God forbid, but what happens if it actually gets worse next year and the year after?”</em></p>



<p>Advising the government on the need to be creative, he said there are questions that the decision-makers should consider in arriving at a final decision.</p>



<p><em>“Can we get the exact number of students eligible to write WASSCE examination this year? Can we study their spread across the country?</em></p>



<p><em>What logistics challenge does each location present in terms of COVID-19 safety measures? How long does it normally take to write the examination?</em></p>



<p><em>Do we need to stretch it out longer to allow fewer number of candidates into the examination hall at one time?</em></p>



<p><em>Can we set up minimum safety requirements that each centre must meet if it must serve as an examination centre? Do we need to request for a postponement for another month or so to enable us put all these measures in place?”</em> he asked.</p>



<p><em>“Even the south-west states would value the lives of the children more than they value education. Same with other countries in the WAEC arrangement.</em></p>



<p><em>Why then, are they insisting on proceeding with the examinations? Are there things we can learn from them in rolling out a nationwide plan? The decision not to write the examination is an option.</em></p>



<p><em>But we need to consider other options as well and chose what is best for the children rather than what we consider most convenient for everyone.”Abdullahi concluded.</em></p>

<p>A murder suspect arrested over serial killings in Akinyele area of Ibadan, Oyo state has said he received food and N500 for each of the six persons he murdered in the area.</p>



<p>Within a month, at least five persons, including a pregnant woman and two students, were hacked to death in the community.</p>



<p>The suspect was among the 19 being paraded on Friday by the state commissioner of police, Mr. Nwachuckwu Enwonwu, for offences ranging from armed robbery, rape to motorcycle theft among others.</p>



<p>The 19-year-old suspect said he was sent on the mission by a 50-year-old herbalist, whom he claimed was his master.</p>



<p><em>“Anytime I’m to go for the killing, baba will give me some charms and also teach me some incantation to recite so that nobody will see me at the scene of the crime,”</em> he said.</p>



<p><em>“I will hit the victims with a shovel and recite the incantation immediately I saw blood coming out of the victims’ body.</em></p>



<p><em>“Baba instructed me to always move around the victims at the scene after killing them and then turn my back on them, staying there for like three minutes; which I did and nobody will see me.</em></p>



<p><em>“Baba said the spirits of the victims will come to him after I killed them. Baba did not tell me the reason for the killings, but does buy me food and gives me N500 after each of the killings I carried out for him.”</em></p>



<p>The herbalist denied the accusations, saying the suspect was brought to him by his parents to learn about herbs.</p>



<p><em>“The boy was brought to me in 2016 and only spent six days with me and I sent him away and since then I have not seen him,”</em> the herbalist said.</p>



<p><em>“I only saw him some days ago when he came with the police, though I do give him food.”</em></p>



<p>The Commissioner of police said the 19-year-old suspect was arrested through a phone he stole belonging to one of the murder victims, Azeezat Shomuyiwa, in which he later led operatives of the special anti-robbery squad to the hideout of the herbalist.</p>



<p>Enwonwu said the sinister technique employed by the suspect was to target female victims, attack them with dangerous weapons, rob them off their belongings before hacking them to death.</p>



<p>He said the suspect confessed to carrying out various criminal activities within Ojo’o, Akinyele and Moniya areas of Ibadan.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;He attacked and killed an 18-year-old, Barakat Bello, on June 1; attacked and killed 21-year-old Grace Oshiagwu on June 13; killed five-year-old Mojeed Tirimisiyu on June 22, all in Akinyele,</em>&#8221; Enwonwu said.</p>



<p>&#8220;His last operation was carried out on June 29 when he attacked Mrs Adeola Azeez and her daughter with a shovel.</p>



<p>&#8220;The duo  were seriously injured on the head. He carted away their phones and money. The victims are currently responding to treatment at the hospital,&#8221; the CP concluded.</p>

<p>During the visit, the Governor said the Borno State Government will not accept the services of unqualified teachers in primary schools across the state.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FB_IMG_1594945835477.jpg?resize=483%2C321&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-60502" width="483" height="321" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Addressing members of the verification Committee, Zulum said <em>“this morning we have inspected primary schools within the metropolis, I have constituted a committee few months ago, and have exermined the structures. </em></p>



<p><em>Insha Allah, we will provide all the necessary infrastructures at our primary schools, but the most important thing is the teachers. </em></p>



<p><em>If you cannot have qualified teachers in the primary schools, I think all the face-lift and the rehabilitation are exercise in futility.”</em></p>



<p><em>“We will give greater priority to the kind of teachers in our primary schools, if the foundation is weak there is no way the Secondary and tertiary education in the state will be sound. </em></p>



<p><em>The quality of pupils in the primary schools determine our output in secondary schools.”</em> Said Zulum</p>



<p><em>“The major reason our students in secondary schools cannot obtain credits, is because they don&#8217;t have the requisite training at the primary schools level. </em></p>



<p><em>This administration will give all the necessary support to you to be able to discharge your duties. </em></p>



<p><em>We will exermine your report at the end of the exercise, those that we felt they should be allowed to go on training, we can train them.”</em> Zulum, a professor of soil and water engineering  added.</p>



<p>Governor Zulum, also addressing a number of teachers from Damboa local government who have turn out for the verification assured of their welfare and improved atmosphere for teaching and learning.</p>



<p><em>“We shall insha Allah provide accommodation for teachers, loans and improve the welfare of our teachers. But how can we do that ? We have to get the system right, our teachers should be qualified and genuine.” Zulum said.</em></p>
