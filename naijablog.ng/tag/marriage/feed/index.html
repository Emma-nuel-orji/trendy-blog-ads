<p>Diaz and her business partner Katherine Power were guests on the Lipstick on the Rim with Molly Sims‚Äô podcast in which she voiced her opinion on married couples sleeping in separate bedrooms.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe should normalize separate bedrooms,‚Äù she shared. She said some couples might need two different houses. To me, I would literally, I have my house, you have yours. We have the family house in the middle. I will go and sleep in my room. You go sleep in your room. I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù</p>



<p>She added, ‚ÄúAnd we have the bedroom in the middle that we can convene in for our, you know, relations.‚Äù</p>



<p>As Power and host Molly Sims laughed, Diaz clarified that she used to believe separate rooms would be a great idea for her marriage before she said ‚ÄúI do‚Äù to Madden. ‚ÄúBy the way, I don‚Äôt feel that way now because my husband is so wonderful. I said that before I got married,‚Äù she explained.</p>

<p>A 74 year-man in Kogi State, Muhammad Awal on Sunday broke decades streak of bachelorhood as he got married for the first time in an event that witnessed a mammoth crowd of well wishers in Lokoja, the state capital.</p>



<p>Awal who had given up, stated that he was destined to marry this late, got married according to Islamic rites to 45 year-old divorcee, Rahmat Muhammad.</p>



<p>To him, despite encouragement from family, friends and even some Islamic teachers that he should be brave and approach a lady he liked for marriage, he said his lack of financial capacity had held him back several times.</p>



<p>‚ÄúI have always been afraid I might fail in my duty of care to a spouse if I married and it is something I fear and don‚Äôt want to joke with.</p>



<p>‚ÄúI am also afraid of separation from my spouse. I know if I fail to take care of her, she might either leave me or cheat on me with another man, which I would not like. So, to avoid all of that, I dismissed the idea of marriage altogether. But now, Allah has made this a reality.‚Äù</p>



<p>On whether he has ever approached a woman to proposition marriage before, ‚ÄúI have. Many. This was when i was much younger. Many of them looked down on me, mostly because of my</p>



<p>Asked whether he would have long been married had his financial situation been different, he replied in the affirmative, even as he added that if God had designed it differently, it would still have not been possible.</p>



<p>On what attracted him to his new wife and whether he would sire children with her, he said, ‚ÄúApart from the fact that she is beautiful, she is also down-to-earth, understanding, religious and rooted in the marital institution.</p>



<p>‚ÄúOnly Allah knows if we are going to have children. You never know what the Almighty can do. It is not in our hands, but His hands.‚Äù</p>



<p>In her reaction, the new wife also admitted that it was destined that they would end up as a couple and prayed Allah to accept their wishes towards each other.</p>



<p>On her choice of Mallam Awal, ‚Äúwhy not him? she retorted. Allah has a reason for bringing us together and my prayers is for him to bless us and give us peace and understanding in our home.‚Äù</p>

<p>According to an eyewitness report posted online:</p>



<p>Drama as bridegroom walks out of engagement ceremony in Isiala Ngwa due to extortion.</p>



<p>He paid N1,500,000 to cater for food, tents, chairs and a public address system.</p>



<p>He was also made to set aside N100,000 as the bride price that the two families had agreed on.</p>



<p>Okwudili was asked to add N50,000 to the bride price because he had already impregnated the girl.</p>



<p>He was slapped with a N10,000 fine for making a detour to the wrong path and ending up in a different homestead instead of the girl&#8217;s.</p>



<p>He was also asked to pay N15,000 to appease the elders who had become tired of waiting for his arrival.</p>



<p>Drama however ensued when twelve girls covered in loose robes from head to toe were paraded before Okwudili and he was asked to guess who his fianc√©e was.</p>



<p>He pointed at the wrong woman and that lead to yet another fine of N15,000 thrice</p>



<p>The decisive moment specifically was when the elders demanded for a refund of the total sum of N850,000 that had been paid as the girl&#8217;s school fees and upkeep since she started primary school!</p>



<p>Fuming with anger which he tried his best to hide, Okwudili excused himself to visit a nearby latrine and disappeared!</p>



<p>He switched off his phone and was last seen in a bus heading to Lagos from Owerri.</p>

<p><strong><em>By Harrison Essien, From Uyo Akwa Ibom</em></strong></p>



<p>A young lady In Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State (name withheld by me) whose pre-wedding pictures had trended on social media, slumped this evening on the day of her traditional marriage as her biological father canceled the TM in a broad daylight.</p>



<p>As early as 4pm, family members and friends of the bride and her husband to-be, who came from far and near, had thronged the Government Primary School, venue of the traditional marriage, which is a stone&#8217;s throw from the State Police Command&#8217;s Headquarters.</p>



<p>Live band was performing, entertaining guests while waiting for the commencement of the traditional rites.</p>



<p>But to the surprise of everyone, the bride&#8217;s father walked into the arena and insisted that the traditional marriage would not hold because his son in-law&#8217;s was owing him N70,000 bride price balance.</p>



<p>On hearing of her dad&#8217;s action, the bride collapsed with her friends battling to revive her and the traditional marriage ended in a fiasco.</p>

<p>Nigerian lady identify as Saleemat Mamman has reacted contrary to others women believed when it come to marrying second wife by their husband.</p>



<p>Saleemat while given some piece of advice to women who kick against their husband decision in taken second, third or fourth wife, said she will prayer for husband to get a second wife that is far better than her.</p>



<p>The young lady who share her opinions concerning second wife on her Facebook wall, has this to say:</p>



<p>&#8220;When will Women learn that their husband is not their property.<br>He has legal right to four.</p>



<p>The new wife did not come to steal your husband.</p>



<p>She came to marry her husband‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.</p>



<p>He is hers just as much as he is yours.</p>



<p>Stop making second, third and fourth wives look like theives.</p>



<p>They didn&#8217;t choose their destinies.</p>



<p>Marrying other wives Islamically and legally is better than keeping concubines and mistresses.</p>



<p>My only prayer for my husband if he ever choose to marry more is &#8221; May he find a better woman than me&#8221;</p>



<p>A sister wife that would love me and accept my kids just like hers&#8221;.</p>



<p>Death doesn&#8217;t give notice and of I were to die today, I would prefer my kids be taken care by someone I know than a stranger. At least she will be under a divine trust, a sin unto her, if the trust is broken.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t tell me such women don&#8217;t exist because they do‚Ä¶.</p>



<p>The men too should try to practice polygamy with equality.</p>



<p>May our husbands find good women if they ever want or need extra wives.<br>Aameen.&#8221;</p>
