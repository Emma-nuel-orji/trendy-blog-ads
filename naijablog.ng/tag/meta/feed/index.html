<p>Today, Meta announced the launch of the AMBER Alert Programme on Facebook and Instagram in Nigeria. Working in partnership with the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), this programme is aimed at helping to find abducted children by sending AMBER Alerts to the local Facebook and Instagram community in Nigeria.</p>



<p>AMBER Alert is designed to increase the chances of finding missing children by putting more people on the lookout for them. When an AMBER Alert is activated by law enforcement, the alert will appear on the Facebook and Instagram Feed of users within the designated search area, enabling them to share the information instantly with friends or contact the authorities if they have leads.</p>



<p>AMBER Alert is designed to include important information about the missing child such as a photo description, location of the abduction, and other relevant and available information to aid in immediately identifying the missing child.</p>



<p>Emily Vacher, Meta’s Director of Trust and Safety, said:&nbsp;<em>“Already available across 28 countries globally, we are proud to partner with NAPTIP to make AMBER Alert available in Nigeria – the second African country to join this programme. When there is a reported case of a missing child, the most valuable thing one can do is share information as quickly as possible. By working with law enforcement in helping to share the right information with the right people, we hope that missing children will be safely reunited with their families faster.”</em></p>



<p>In emphasising the importance of this launch, Adaora Ikenze, Meta’s Head of Public Policy, Anglophone West Africa, said:<em>&nbsp;“This partnership with NAPTIP is another important milestone in reinforcing our ongoing commitment to Nigeria. We know our apps can be used as a force for good, and the AMBER Alert launch across Instagram and Facebook highlights this.”</em></p>



<p><strong><em>How AMBER Alert Works</em></strong></p>



<p><em>The decision to declare an AMBER Alert is made by NAPTIP when investigating a suspected abduction case, they must first determine if the case meets their Amber Alert criteria, which includes:</em></p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abduction is of a child age 17 or younger</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NAPTIP must have reasonable belief that there has been an abduction.</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NAPTIP believes the victim is in imminent danger of serious bodily harm or exploitation.</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is enough descriptive information about the victim and suspected abduction for law enforcement to issue an AMBER Alert to assist in recovering the child</p>



<p>Once these criterias have been met, NAPTIP will then notify Meta’s Global Security Operations Centre, which operates 24/7, that a verified AMBER Alert is active. Meta will then send the alert to the News Feeds of people located in targeted search areas in Nigeria.</p>



<p>Dr. Fatima Waziri-Azi, the Director General of NAPTIP&nbsp; also said,&nbsp;<em>“Today we are partnering with Meta to launch the AMBER Alert Programme on Facebook and Instagram to help ensure faster response in finding missing children. With these alerts, more people can be on the lookout for kids reported missing in their vicinity and report all leads to relevant authorities. NAPTIP cherishes every aspect of the intending collaboration and we are indeed glad to be on board with Meta”.</em></p>



<p>AMBER Alert Programme launched on Facebook in 2015 and since then has assisted in hundreds of successful child endangerment cases in the US and around the world.</p>



<p>One of such cases happened in 2020 when Amanda Disley and her husband helped rescue 11-year-old Charlotte Moccia of Springfield, Massachusetts, after seeing an AMBER Alert on Facebook. Before that, a four-year-old girl was recovered after Kaytlin Brown saw an AMBER Alert issued on Facebook on her lunch break and quickly took action.</p>



<p>In June 2022, Meta added Instagram to the AMBER Alerts Programme across the world by making it available in 28 additional countries, and now, in Nigeria. As part of the launch of AMBER Alerts in Nigeria, Meta and NAPTIP will be educating users in Nigeria on how to identify AMBER Alerts on their feed and what to do when they see an alert.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>22 August 2022: Today, Meta announced that applications for the AR/VR Africa Metathon in partnership with Imisi 3D and BlackRhino VR are now open. The AR/VR Africa Metathon is a series of programmes and activations under the Meta global XR fund aimed at supporting African XR talents to build innovative solutions that demonstrate various use cases of the metaverse in Africa.</p>



<p>The AR/VR Metathon will feature three major components including a training program, an Africa-wide hackathon which will take place&nbsp; across 16 countries in Africa physically and open to everyone virtually, followed by an intensive bootcamp to further develop solutions. These components will run from Mid-August – April 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Phil Oduor, Policy Programs Lead for Africa at Meta, “The AR/VR Africa Metathon is an opportunity to demonstrate how artificial intelligence, augmented reality and virtual reality technologies that have been around for decades, are core to the future of the metaverse and what Africans are building in the industry.” Oduor further adds, “The XR Programs and Research Fund is a two-year $50 million investment into programs and external research focused on building the metaverse responsibly. Through this fund, we are collaborating with industry partners, civil rights groups, governments, nonprofits and academic institutions to determine how to build these technologies responsibly. This is why we have partnered with Imisi 3D and BlackRhino VR, an extended reality ecosystem developer&nbsp; and a virtual reality production company, who represent Africa’s creative and innovative landscape, to launch this program to support African XR talent who are building innovative solutions that demonstrate the various aspects of the metaverse in Africa.”</p>



<p>Judith Okonkwo, Founder Imisi 3D &amp; AR/VR Africa said, “Six&nbsp;years after our first hackathon, and following subsequent events in over 28 countries across the continent, we are especially thrilled to be partnering with Meta and BlackRhino VR for the 2022 edition. This year’s AR/VR Africa Metathon brings together our AR/VR Africa pre-hackathon training, hackathon, and bootcamp in one programme. Working with partners in 16 countries, it is our biggest and most ambitious event yet&nbsp; providing even greater access for XR. In addition to physical events in these countries, we welcome participants across the continent who will be able to learn and hack virtually. At this time of intense global interest in the Metaverse, our mission remains the same &#8211; increasing access to XR resources on the continent, accelerating XR talent, showcasing African XR solutions and creating pathways for careers and industry.”</p>



<p>&#8220;We are honored and elated to have partnered with Meta and Imis 3D on this promising project. The Metathon will encourage exploration and discovery among young African creative technologists who will have the opportunity to develop Afrocentric XR use cases that will tackle some of the unique challenges they are facing in our continent. This type of collaboration is what Africa needs to highlight the potential of new and untapped socioeconomic opportunities created by XR Technologies&#8221; commented Brian Afande, Co-founder and Managing Director, BlackRhino VR.</p>



<p>All developers, programmers, UI/UX designers, artists, animators, storytellers, professionals and students interested in participating in the 12 weeks training can register through this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://form.typeform.com/to/qHCfq759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://form.typeform.com/to/qHCfq759</a>&nbsp;for the opportunity to share their innovative work in AR/VR</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, Meta announced that it has built and open sourced ‘No Language Left Behind’&nbsp;<a href="https://ai.facebook.com/research/no-language-left-behind/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NLLB-200</a>, a single AI model that is the first to translate across 200 different languages, including 55 African languages with state-of-the-art results. Meta is using the modelling techniques and learnings from the project to improve and extend translations on Facebook, Instagram, and Wikipedia.</p>



<p>In an&nbsp;<a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/teaching-ai-to-translate-100s-of-spoken-and-written-languages-in-real-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">effort to develop high-quality machine translation capabilities for most of the world’s low-resource languages</a>, this single AI model was designed with a focus on African languages. They are challenging from a machine translation perspective. AI models require lots and lots of data to help them learn, and there&#8217;s not a lot of human translated training data for these languages. For example, there’s more than 20M people who speak and write in Luganda but examples of this written language are extremely difficult to find on the internet.</p>



<p>We worked with professional translators for each of these languages to develop a reliable benchmark which can automatically assess translation quality for many low-resource languages. We also work with professional translators to do human evaluation too, meaning people who speak the languages natively evaluate what the AI produced. The reality is that a handful of languages dominate the web, so only a fraction of the world can access content and contribute to the web in their own language. We want to change this by creating more inclusive machine translations systems – ones that unlock access to the web for the more than 4B people around the world that are currently excluded because they do not speak one of the few languages content is available in.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s impressive how much AI is improving all of our services. We just open-sourced an AI model we built that can translate across 200 different languages &#8212; many of which aren&#8217;t supported by current translation systems. We call this project No Language Left Behind, and the AI modelling techniques we used are helping make high quality translations for languages spoken by billions of people around the world. To give a sense of the scale, the 200-language model has over 50 billion parameters, and we trained it using our new Research SuperCluster, which is one of the world’s fastest AI supercomputers. The advances here will enable more than 25 billion translations every day across our apps. Communicating across languages is one superpower that AI provides, but as we keep advancing our AI work it&#8217;s improving everything we do &#8212; from showing the most interesting content on Facebook and Instagram, to recommending more relevant ads, to keeping our services safe for everyone.</p>



<p>,” said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a post on his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook profile</a>.</p>



<p>Language is our culture, identity, and lifeline to the world. However, as high-quality translation tools don’t exist for hundreds of languages, billions of people today can&#8217;t access digital content or participate fully in conversations and communities online in their preferred or native languages. This is especially true for hundreds of millions of people who speak the many languages of Africa.</p>



<p>“Africa is a continent with very high linguistic diversity, and language barriers exist day to day. We are pleased to announce that 55 African languages will be included in this machine translation research, making it a major breakthrough for our continent,” Balkissa Ide Siddo, Public Policy Director for Africa said while speaking about the launch of the AI model. “In the future, imagine visiting your favourite Facebook group, coming across a post in Igbo or Luganda, and being able to understand it in your own language with just a click of a button – that’s where we hope research like this leads us. Highly accurate translations in more languages could also help to spot harmful content and misinformation, protect election integrity, and curb instances of online sexual exploitation and human trafficking.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While commenting on accessibility and inclusion in the pursuit of building an equitable metaverse, Ide Siddo added “At Meta, we are working today to ensure that as many people as possible will be able to access the new educational, social and economic opportunities that the next evolution of the internet will bring to future technology and an everyday living experience tomorrow.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To confirm that the translations are high quality, Meta also created a new evaluation dataset,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/flores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FLORES-200</a>, and measured NLLB-200’s performance in each language. Results revealed that NLLB-200 exceeds the previous state of the art by an average of 44 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meta is also open-sourcing the NLLB-200 model and publishing a slew of research tools to enable other researchers to extend this work to more languages and build more inclusive technologies. Meta AI is also providing up to $200,000 of grants to non-profit organizations for real world applications for NLLB-200.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are versions of Wikipedia in more than 300 languages, but most have far fewer articles than the 6+ million available in English. Following Meta’s partnership with the&nbsp;<a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikimedia Foundation</a>, the non-profit organization that hosts Wikipedia and other free knowledge projects, modelling&nbsp; techniques and learnings from the NLLB research are now also being applied to translation systems used by Wikipedia editors.

<p><br>Lagos, Nigeria &#8211; June 20, 2022: Meta has officially launched the Meta Non-profit training program, a digital capacity building program for 1,500 non-profit personnel across Anglophone West Africa. <br>At the event which took place in Lagos recently, Meta also announced its support for Geda Digital training, a six month Social Innovators Bootcamp Program for Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). These trainings are aimed at supporting the non-profit and social impact sector across Anglophone West Africa. </p>



<p><br>“We know the value of digital skills and Meta is committed to helping non-profits and social enterprises across Nigeria acquire these skills by providing them with information that will increase their overall digital awareness” Adaora Ikenze, Head of Public Policy for Anglophone West Africa said while giving opening address during the launch event. “We recognise the needs of these NGOs and we are excited to partner with NGOs who leverage our family of apps for impact. We are delighted to provide the required support in upskilling them to scale and strengthen the work they do within their communities”.<br>While giving the keynote address, Maryam Uwais, Special Advisor to President Muhammadu Buhari on Social Investments, said, “We commend the initiatives of Meta towards developing people working in the non-profit sector. This investment is deeply appreciated by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Meta has continuously been a partner to the government, we must continue with this partnership to make Nigeria a better place”.</p>



<p><br>During a fireside chat at the event, Adeyemi Adenike, Chief Executive Officer, FATE Foundation stressed the need for NGOs to identify cost effective methods of reaching their target audience and sharing their impact stories, especially by leveraging Meta family of apps during the chat. Buttressing this, Chidi Koldsweat, Founder/CEO, Donors for Africa Foundation, stated that the collaboration with Meta on the Geda Digital Training will be helpful in providing visibility for NGOs.<br>To further underscore Meta’s longstanding approach to connecting with more allies and supporting NGOs that are using Meta’s family of Apps for good, Meta held a series of engagements with the social impact sector in 2021, including listening sessions and training for non-profit organisations. Meta also held pilot sessions of its Meta Non-Profit program with partners in Tanzania, Nigeria and South Africa.</p>



<p><br>Applications for the Geda Digital Bootcamp and Meta Non-profit training are now open.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>23 May 2022 – As part of its Africa Day celebrations on 25 May, Meta today announced the return of its global campaign&nbsp;<strong><em>‘Made by Africa, Loved by the World’</em></strong>, which was first launched in 2021. Aimed at amplifying the voices and stories of people and businesses from across Africa that are impacting the world, this year’s campaign spotlights eight creators, innovators and SMBs who are making a name for themselves not only in Africa, but globally, and are changing the way Africa is viewed on the international stage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/generic_a_d_1_1_dark1248681849234442471-scaled.jpg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-111912" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>As part of the on-platform and marketing campaign, Meta has partnered with local filmmakers to bring to life eight phenomenal stories. Alongside this will run a dedicated global and local Instagram campaign featuring partnerships with African content creators, a community Reels challenge, the development of a specially designed AR filter inspired by #AfricaMade, as well as a&nbsp;series of free open virtual training sessions via the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetaAfrica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meta Africa page</a>, dedicated to all SMBs and Creators from across Africa.</p>



<p>Speaking about the campaign, Kezia Anim-Addo, Communications Director, Sub-Saharan Africa, said, “I’m truly excited to be bringing back&nbsp;<em>‘Made by Africa, Loved by the World’</em>&nbsp;for the 2nd year running. This campaign is about showcasing the incredible talent we have here on the continent, and the African people and businesses that are not only contributing to the global agenda, but are forging their own paths. At Meta we remain invested in Africa, and know that this is home to some of the world’s most talented and inspired individuals, and we look forward to hero’ing just some of these stories through our<em>&nbsp;‘Made by Africa, Loved by the World’&nbsp;</em>campaign.”</p>



<p><strong>Short Films: Made by Africa, Loved by the World</strong></p>



<p>Partnering with five local filmmakers Tarryn Crossman (South Africa), Kofi Awuah (Ghana), Joan Kabugu (Kenya), Bardia Olowu (Nigeria) and Nelson Makengo (DRC), these series of inspirational and beautifully shot short films will live on a dedicated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/m/madebylovedby/africa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Africa Day microsite</a>&nbsp;and focus on the stories of:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em></em></p>

<p><strong>Lagos, Nigeria &#8211; 20 April, 2022</strong>&nbsp;– Ramadan is unlike any other time of year. It is a season of transformation that changes the behaviours and attitudes of many people around the world and provides them with a renewed sense of purpose. This global season of reflection and introspection is observed by almost two billion people around the world, fasting daily and connecting with friends and family. Gifting and shopping are also a big part of the Ramadan season and as a result, many discoveries are taking place across borders because of the shifts in people’s openness to explore new things during Ramadan.</p>



<p>Elizma Nolte, Head of Marketing, Africa at Meta said: &#8220;Ramadan is a time of transformation and celebration for people around the world. By enabling easier discovery, reducing friction and delivering messaging that feels inclusive and representative, brands can meaningfully connect with this diverse community of observers and shoppers.”</p>

<p>The research highlights the booming e-commerce industry is significantly driving the digital economy in Nigeria. Here are four tips for Nigerian businesses to leverage shift in mindsets and effectively unlock new opportunities for discovery during the season:</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Discover how people support businesses during Ramadan</strong></p>



<p>The theme of giving back is deeply rooted in Ramadan. People are increasingly giving back with time and money &#8211; and this extends to local businesses too.<strong>&nbsp;86%&nbsp;</strong>agree that brands should find ways of giving back during Ramadan. As people personally contribute to their communities, they increasingly expect the same of businesses. They want brands to express their values, speak authentically and stand up for causes they care about. In fact, the research also shows that&nbsp;<strong>71%</strong>&nbsp;of survey respondentsin Nigeriabecame more interested in a brand after learning about their business practices. That is why brands must raise awareness of their support for local businesses and the community during the month of good in a clear and simple way. During Ramadan,&nbsp;<strong>50%</strong>&nbsp;of respondents say that they show support for local businesses by following or liking their business page on social media.&nbsp;<strong>49%</strong>&nbsp;of respondents say that they support local businesses by making a conscious effort to purchase from them while&nbsp;<strong>48%</strong>&nbsp;of respondents recommend small businesses to family and friends. By leveraging this information, local businesses can better position themselves to be discovered during the #MonthOfGood, giving them an opportunity to drive commerce and reach new audiences.</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Learn about content preferences</strong></p>



<p>During Ramadan, people look to Meta services like Facebook and Instagram to connect with online communities, stay entertained and learn new things. They also desire inclusive and representative Ramadan content from brands on Instagram and Facebook. The research shows that&nbsp;<strong>96%&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;of survey respondents in Nigeria are open to brands/businesses advertising to them on Facebook or Instagram during the Ramadan/Eid al-Fitr season. While the majority of the respondents would like to see content that is informative, authentic, inspiring and creative,&nbsp;<strong>49%</strong>&nbsp;of respondents say that they would also like to see content that updates them on latest offers and discounts. Knowing this, businesses can leverage Meta services to reach new audiences and unlock opportunities for commerce.</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Explore partnerships with Creators and Influencers</strong></p>



<p>Creators offer a new source of credibility.&nbsp; Amongst the Ramadan observing and shopping community surveyed in Nigeria,&nbsp;<strong>53%</strong>&nbsp;agreed that public figures and celebrities influence their purchasing decisions as they offer impartial advice. Interestingly,&nbsp;<strong>77%&nbsp;</strong>of these respondents also say that following these public figures is a great way to discover new trends. With the world of creators predicted to grow by&nbsp;another<a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;$4.1billion</a>&nbsp;this year alone, now is the time for brands to engage and partner with creators&nbsp;to help reach new audiences in an authentic way and should explore collaborating with creators who can inspire, generate deals and announce trends.</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Explore purchasing behaviours</strong></p>



<p>There is a need for businesses to dive deeper into how people evaluate and make purchases for the season and what factors inform those market decisions. The demand from shoppers online is greater than ever as they spend less time shopping in physical stores during the month of Ramadan.&nbsp;<strong>88%</strong>&nbsp;of respondents say online shopping is the easiest way to discover products, indicating a 4% increase from 2020. This shows that more people have embraced online shopping as the preferred alternative for making purchases during Ramadan. The research shows&nbsp;<strong>82%</strong>&nbsp;of respondents agreeing that Facebook and/or Instagram helps them discover new products and services during the Ramadan season with&nbsp;<strong>72%</strong>&nbsp;of respondents buying products this Ramadan that they first discovered on Facebook and/or Instagram.&nbsp;<strong>74%</strong>&nbsp;of the respondents also confirmed they would try new brands when they shop e-commerce and retail. This means that brands must leverage the different purchasing behaviours during the month of Ramadan and adapt their business to reach the right audience online, where they are most likely to be found.</p>

We recognise the resilience of women entrepreneurs and we are happy to celebrate them on this International Women&#8217;s Day.

<p>In her keynote address, Hajia Aisha Abubakar, Chairwoman NACCIMA Business Women Group and former Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment, encouraged women not to underestimate their value, to break the bias and keep pushing beyond the boundaries. In addition, a panel session was led by the Weekend Editor of BusinessDay Newspaper, Lehle Balde, with panelists including Adenike Adeyemi, CEO, FATE Foundation; Abosede Alimi (George-Ogan), Founder, WILAN Global &amp; ElectHER; Thelma Ekiyor, Founder Afrigrants; and Kofo Adebiyi, CEO, She Leads Africa.</p>

<p>The event also celebrated the collaboration between Meta and it&#8217;s local partners who have succeeded in championing initiatives that support women-business owners in Nigeria. One such initiative is the #SheMeansBusiness, a program aimed at equipping women-business owners with digital marketing skills to achieve their business goals. So far, the program has directly trained over 20,000 female entrepreneurs in Nigeria, and will reach more this year.</p>
