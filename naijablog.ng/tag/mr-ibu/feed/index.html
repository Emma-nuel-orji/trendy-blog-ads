<p>Recall that the veteran actor passed on a few weeks ago after battling illness for a couple of months.</p>



<p>According to content creator Tosin, during a meeting today, the brother and first son of Mr Ibu got into a fight which resulted in bruises and bleeding.</p>

<p>The family of the comic actor, John Okafor, aka Mr. Ibu, has addressed misconceptions surrounding Mr. Ibu&#8217;s health, stating that contrary to circulating reports on social media, the actor has undergone amputation on only one leg, not both.</p>



<p>They added that the initial amputation proved insufficient to resolve his health challenges, leading to a subsequent amputation on the same leg.</p>



<p>The family also refuted claims attributing Mr. Ibu&#8217;s illness to diabetes disclosing that the actor has been contending with clotting of the blood in his leg, attributed to diseased blood vessels.</p>



<p>This was disclosed in a statement on the actor’s Instagram page on Saturday, December 16.</p>



<p>It read, “We wish to express our sincere gratitude to well-meaning Nigerians and the general public for your immense contributions, physically, spiritually, and most above all financially on getting our daddy Mr John Okafor (Mr Ibu) back on his feet again.</p>



<p>“We wish to correct some misconceptions making rounds on social media concerning the current state of our father’s health.</p>



<p>“First, we would like to state that our daddy wasn’t amputated on both legs but only one. The first amputation didn’t completely correct his health predicament so the doctors had to go ahead to amputate the same leg further to ensure we didn’t lose him.</p>



<p>“Daddy’s cause of sickness is also not diabetes but he’s had constant clotting of the blood in his leg (diseased blood vessels) and other health challenges posing risk to his life, therefore the need for the amputation.</p>



<p>“Lastly, the only reason why the family has not flown him out of the country to date is that the doctors have tagged him &#8216;Not Fit to Fly&#8217;.</p>



<p>&#8220;This tag has made it extremely impossible to get him out of the country for advanced treatment as no airline will fly him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Daddy is currently admitted at one of the biggest and best hospitals we’ve got in Nigeria as of today and the hospital has availed him a pool of very astute professionals.</p>



<p>“As Daddy is recuperating, we urge his friends, colleagues, fans, and Nigerians at large to keep him in their prayers and peddle down on unconfirmed reports concerning our dad’s health.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you Nigerians you all have been very supportive this period. God bless you all.&#8221;</p>



<p>Previous reports in October indicated that Mr. Ibu successfully underwent five surgeries and was scheduled to be flown abroad for further treatment.</p>

<p>Mr Ibu, a Nollywood actor known for his comic roles in movies has said that coronavirus in Nigeria is a scam.</p>
<p>The actor whose real name is John Okafor said,</p>
<p>“Nigeria, we are not supposed to be involved in this COVID-19, I see no reason why we should be involved.</p>
<p>Only Nigerians in diaspora will have to partake in this devilish program.</p>
<p>We at home are oblivious, we are not supposed to be involved in any ceremony in trying to pretend or in trying to avoid.</p>
<p>My brother, COVID-19 or 20 is not here, I don’t careI no dey fear anything I dey wear cloth waka on my own.</p>
<p>Nothing dey here, nobody don die for this whole area, if you go another area nobody don die, go to stadium nobody don die. Let’s be sorry for ourselves.”</p>
<p>When asked to comment the rising numbers of cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria, Mr Ibu said,</p>
<p>“You know anybody? Have you ever attended any burial and they say na this thing kill am?</p>
<p>have you ever gone to the hospital them say this person na Covid dey hold am?</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a family them say somebody na Covid na em kill am yesterday for family wey you know?</p>
<p>You cannot, dem say dem say na em me and you dey hear. Even the sickness dey fear us.</p>
<p>Are they not human beings, let them bring a picture of at least one person killed by COVID-19 and we find the family of such a person.</p>
<p>COVID whatever is not in Nigeria, we have hot weather here, the disease is scared of us just as we are scared of it so it can’t come here.</p>
<p>It has affected so many industries in the country, it has driven us away from work because of the lies and gossip.</p>
<p>Na small thing e remain hunger for don kill me since if no be say better people dey wey dey give us money.”</p>
