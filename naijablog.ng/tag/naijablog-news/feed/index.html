<p>Operatives of the Office of the Special Adviser on Central Business Districts have sealed some shops within the Lagos Island Business District for violating the COVID-19 trading hours issued by the State Government to shops as part of efforts to contain the Coronavirus pandemic.</p>



<p>The Special Adviser to the Lagos State Governor on Central Business Districts, Mr. Olugbenga Oyerinde disclosed this on Friday, warning other recalcitrant traders, who are in the habit of trading beyond the 3.00 pm stipulated time, to desist or have their shops equally sealed.</p>



<p>While decrying the nonchalant attitude of some traders towards obeying the COVID-19 directives, the Special Adviser declared that his office will enforce all the health safety guidelines issued by the State Government to flatten the curve of the dreaded disease in Lagos.</p>



<p>He, therefore, called on traders and visitors as well as business owners within the business district to adhere strictly to the stipulated COVID-19 directives issued by the Lagos State Government and relevant authorities.</p>

<p>Philippines’ national penitentiary has revealed that no fewer than 21 inmates have died from the coronavirus since March, including a prisoner who testified against an opposition’ senator detained on illegal drug charges</p>



<p>Tis was disclosed by prison officials on Monday, July, 20, 2020.</p>



<p><em>“A total of 349 inmates at the New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa City in metro Manila have been infected with the coronavirus since March,’’</em> Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said.</p>



<p>Only five inmates remain in the prison’s quarantine and isolation facility, he added, citing information from the Bureau of Corrections.</p>



<p>Among the prisoners who died was Jaybee Santiago, convicted of kidnapping and carjacking in 2009, who ran illegal drug operations from inside the prison.</p>



<p>He testified against Sen. Leila De Lima, who has been detained since February 2017 on allegations she received protection money from jailed illegal drug lords while she was head of the Department of Justice.</p>



<p>However, De Lima has denied the allegations</p>



<p><em>“Sebastian’s body was immediately cremated following the health and safety protocols in handling COVID-19 deaths,’’</em> the Bureau of Corrections said.</p>



<p>Guevarra said he has ordered an investigation into Sebastian’s death “to dispel any doubt” surrounding the circumstances amid speculation he could have been killed or his death staged to let him escape.</p>



<p>The Department of Health reported 1,521 additional confirmed coronavirus infections, bringing the national tally to 68,898.</p>



<p>The death toll was 1,835, with four additional deaths reported.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The 418 new patients were found following the testing of 2,474 samples in the last 24 hours.</h3>



<p>Kenyan authorities on Monday, July 20, 2020 reported 418 new Covid-19 infections, increasing the country’s tally to 13,771 since the virus was first confirmed on March 13.</p>



<p>Health Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS), Rashid Aman also reported four more deaths, raising the toll to 238. </p>



<p>The 418 new patients were found following the testing of 2,474 samples in the last 24 hours.</p>



<p>Four hundred and eight of them were Kenyans and 10 foreigners while male patients numbered 263 and female patients 155.</p>



<p>Dr Aman also announced that 494 patients had been discharged, raising the country’s total number of recoveries to 5,616.</p>



<p>The ministry noted with regret that a number of establishments and bars operate after curfew hours, which run from 9pm to 5am.</p>



<p>“<em>Some of these are restaurants that convert into bars. This is being looked into,”</em> Dr Aman said.</p>



<p>While emphasising the need to observe guidelines for preventing transmission of the disease, the CAS explained that “when an infectious disease strikes a population, it infects many people and in the process people develop an immunity to it”.</p>



<p><em>“Over time most of those who get the disease will have developed an immunity. We are yet to see if that is the case with Covid-19,”</em> he said.</p>



<p>Nairobi and Mombasa counties, which are hardest hit, continued to record the highest attack rates, according to Dr Aman.</p>



<p>He said Nairobi had 7,744 cases as of Monday while Mombasa had 1,835 and Kiambu 769. Kajiado and Busia have also recorded high numbers.</p>



<p>Out of Kenya’s 47 counties, only Baringo, West Pokot and Samburu have not recorded any cases of Covid-19.</p>

<p>Less than 24 hours after the premiere of season 5 of the Big Brother Naija reality TV show, fans have started digging into the lives of the new housemates set to compete for the next ten weeks.</p>



<p>During the launch show, one of the housemates, Praise, who was welcomed by the show’s host, Ebuka, revealed that he’s a single man, which has obviously had ladies on the lookout.</p>



<p>Well, his declaration might have made him subject to research from ladies who might have a thing or two for him and it’s in this vein that it’s been discovered that not only might he not be single, but he might also be a father.</p>



<p>As the banter and reactions to the new housemates are currently flooding social media, a Twitter user took to their platform to share screenshots of Praise, with his wife and a boy.</p>

<p>The Government of Ekiti state has directed traditional rulers in towns and villages to either postpone or cancel for the rest of the year, all pending local festivals in their domains to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>



<p>The State Coordinator of COVID-19 Task Force Response Team, Prof Bolaji Aluko, made the announcement in a statement in Ado Ekiti.</p>



<p>He disclosed that Ekiti State had cumulatively recorded 78 positive Coronavirus cases, with 29 active, 2 deaths and 47 discharged, warning that the cases can rise dramatically if public assemblies continued unchecked.</p>



<p>He said as the state was gradually entering the full blown season of Traditional Festival, therefore, travels from within Ekiti State and various parts of Nigeria by indigenes and visitors to the various towns and villages during this period of the pandemic, had started to occur.</p>



<p>According to him, the attendant incidents of virus transmission in these crowded and boisterous situations, where social distancing is practically impossible, and mask wearing, which is also required, may be impractical for prolonged times.</p>



<p><em>“Consequently, the wise course is to seriously discourage these festivals at this time.</em></p>



<p><em>&#8220;In fact, they are effectively banned by current government guidelines requiring social distancing and limited-number assemblies.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>The Secretary to Most Rev. Callistus Onaga, Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Rev. Fr. Nkemjika Igweshi, anounced this in a statement issued to newsmen in Enugu on Saturday, July 18, 2020.</p>



<p>Igweshi said that Fr. Cabanyes was a Spanish priest of the Opus Dei Prelature who worked in the diocese and had served the Nigerian Church for about 28 years.</p>



<p><em>“He was such a nice, easy-going, cordial, generous, prayerful, and dedicated pastor.</em></p>



<p><em>“He hailed from Spain but loved our people so much and always attended our diocesan functions.</em></p>



<p><em>“His body has just been laid to rest, following the NCDC guidelines.</em></p>



<p><em>“Please as we pray for his peaceful repose, let us know that COVID-19 is real and we will do well to observe all the necessary health precautions and safety measures,’’</em> he said.</p>

<p>Senior doctors in Zimbabwe’s public health service have threatened to strike over low pay and lack of coronavirus protective gear, in the latest dispute to plague the country’s faulty health system.</p>



<p>About 15,000 nurses have been on strike for two weeks over wages that have been hit by galloping inflation.</p>



<p>Coronavirus infections are rising rapidly, reaching 1 089 cases including 20 fatalities, according to official figures.</p>



<p><em>“We are finding it difficult to continue offering services in our work stations because of a number of challenges… for which no solution has been proffered,”</em> the Zimbabwe Senior Hospital Doctors’ Association said.</p>



<p>Its notice to strike, seen by AFP on Thursday, takes effect in two weeks.</p>



<p>Price rises in Zimbabwe are running at more than 700%, eroding salaries and savings and reigniting memories of hyperinflation a decade ago.</p>



<p>President Emmerson Mnangagwa last week axed the health minister, Obadiah Moyo, over corruption allegations involving medical procurement worth $60 million.</p>



<p>Days later, the Health Services Board fired the heads of five state hospitals in what it termed “a restructuring exercise.”</p>
