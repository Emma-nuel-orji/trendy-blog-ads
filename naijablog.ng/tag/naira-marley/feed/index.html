<p>Nollywood actress Iyabo Ojo has reacted to the N500 million lawsuit Nigerian singer Naira Marley brought against her, claiming defamation.</p>



<p>In a statement on her Instagram page, Iyabo Ojo expressed her displeasure with the way the legal action was brought to her notice.</p>



<p>Recall that lawyers of Naira Marley, had demanded a public apology and N500m in damages citing a September 2023 Instagram post by Ojo, where she allegedly accused Marley of engaging in “spiritual and physical dealings” with the late singer Mohbad and causing him “mental harm.”</p>



<p>Naira Marley claimed that the actress had published false and harmful content against him.</p>



<p>However, Iyabo Ojo, in response, filed a complaint against Naira Marley, claiming that he neglected to personally or by mail serve her with the case, raising worries about potential blackmail.</p>



<p>The actress demanded a sum of N1 billion from the singer for what she perceives as deliberately misleading the public.</p>

<p>Nigerian entertainer, Afeez Fashola, also known as Naira Marley, has taken legal action against actress, Iyabo Ojo, alleging the dissemination of false and defamatory content on her Instagram account.</p>



<p>In a letter sent to Ojo, Naira Marley&#8217;s lawyer, Olalekan Ojo, outlined the accusations made in a September 2023 post, stating that the actress accused Naira Marley of engaging in spiritual and physical dealings with the late singer, Ilerioluwa Aloba, widely known as Mohbad.</p>



<p>The lawyer further asserted that Ojo accused Naira Marley of causing mental harm to Mohbad, whom he referred to as a brother.</p>



<p>Naira Marley&#8217;s attorney is seeking a redress of N500 million from Ojo and a public apology.</p>



<p>The counsel asked that the apology be posted on Ojo&#8217;s official Instagram account and published in a national daily.</p>



<p>According to Naira Marley’s lawyer, failure to adhere to the condition placed before her would force them to file a lawsuit against her.</p>



<p>The letter in part reads, “We are Solicitors to Azeez Fashola (a.k.a. Naira Marley) an internationally renowned British and Nigerian Singer/Artist with over seven million followers hereinafter referred to as our client pursuant to whose instruction we write concerning the aboveheaded subject matter.</p>



<p>“It is necessary to preface this letter by stating that in recognition of the iconic status of our client, the Nigeria Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) engaged him to use his skills and platforms to put out content that will discourage millions of his followers and Nigerian youths from substance abuse.</p>



<p>“It is our instruction that sometimes in September, 2023, you maliciously and falsely published of and concerning our client on your official instagram handle &#8216;iyaboojofespris&#8217; the following words: and destroying their lives and leaving them without a kobo to get help…….you go still explain taya bcos evidence dey, that your interview you go still re do am again…….make we get justice for Mohbad first&#8221;.</p>



<p>“It is unarguably clear that the above quoted words are in their ordinary and natural meanings meant or were understood to mean by ordinary right thinking members of the public that have read the post that our Client is a drug addict and that he laced the food and drinks which our Client gave to the boys staying with him with drugs with the resultant effect of occasioning monumental destruction of their lives.</p>



<p>“Your publication of the above words on the internet which is readily accessible to users of the system constituted a very serious libel and has caused our client colossal damage to his reputation.</p>



<p>“It is incontestably clear that the above quoted publication which has been read by countless internet users globally is defamatory of our Client and has brought him to public ridicule and or contempt with the resultant damage to our Client&#8217;s reputation.</p>



<p>“It is our further instruction that since the publication our Client has been inundated with calls from his followers, colleagues, friends and fans all over the world who had read the post expressing their disgust and dismay at the defamatory and libelous publication you had maliciously and falsely posted on your official instagram handle &#8220;iyaboojofespris&#8221; of and concerning our Client.”</p>

<p>Singer, Naira Marley, on Wednesday, said he wants to donate one billion Naira towards the 2023 election but wanted to find out what party his fans are rooting for.</p>



<p>Via his Twitter handle, the singer asked, “I wanna donate 1 billion Naira for 2023 election but what party are we voting for?”</p>



<p>Some of his followers have been responding to his tweets. Big Shaq said, “Oga your net worth no reach like that gan.”</p>



<p>Popular Twitter critic, Daniel Regha added his two cents saying, “Naira Marley u don&#8217;t have a billion, u are not that wealthy, &amp; it&#8217;s advisable u tread carefully since u are still being watched by the EFCC; Having said that, the 2023 elections isn&#8217;t a joke, Nigerians are literally fighting for their lives right now so don&#8217;t chase clout with it.”</p>



<p>Another tweep, Jojo said, “I am sure you have people around you that really need that money. You can give them, and maybe they will be glad you did and advise them to vote (for) competence and a working Nigeria.&#8221;</p>

<p>Singer, Naira Marley has described as disgusting the treatment of record label artiste, Zinoleesky and brothers by operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency.</p>



<p>He alleged that there seem a plot against him and his label mates.</p>



<p>Recall that NDLEA on Thursday arrested Zinoleesky, Mohbad and others.</p>



<p>The Marlian singer tweeted, &#8220;What is happening to my brothers is disgusting. The injustice is unfair and this is beginning to look like a pattern. First me now my artists. Free Zinoleesky, free Shubomi, free Micee and Dosky </p>



<p>&#8220;NDLEA has released Mohbad after physically assaulting him, Zinoleesky is still in custody. The boys are under a lot of stress after being ambushed in the middle of the night with no warrant. I’m urgently returning to Lagos now now now.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mohbad in a Live on his page claimed &#8220;All members of Marlian music and their wives want to kill him&#8221;.</p>

<p>Justice Nicholas Oweibo of the Federal High Court sitting in Ikoyi, Lagos has adjourned the trial of Azeez Fashola, also known as Naira Marley, till February 16, 2022. Marley is being prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on an 11-count charge bordering on conspiracy and credit card fraud. He pleaded &#8220;not guilty&#8221; to the charges when he was arraigned on May 20, 2019.</p>



<p>At the last sitting on October 27, 2021, Augustine Anosike, a forensic analyst testifying as the second prosecution witness, had concluded his examination-in-chief. The court subsequently adjourned till November 30, 2021 for cross-examination.<br>At today&#8217;s proceeding, however, the prosecuting counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo, told the court that the witness was absent in court on &#8220;compassionate grounds”. </p>

<p>Marley popular Nigerian singer, Naira Marley has disclosed his plans for Nigerians if he becomes President.</p>



<p>Naira Marley in a video said he would ban<br>alcohol and legalise weed in order to<br>discourage men from beating up their wives.</p>



<p>The ‘Marlian’ President also said he would<br>ensure 24 hours supply of electricity and will promote unity among different religions and tribes if he becomes president.</p>



<p>In his word: “If I become President, I’ll ban alcohol and legalise weed because men beat up their wives under the influence of alcohol and drink and drive but if you smoke weed, nothing of such happens.&#8221;</p>



<p>“I’ll also provide 24hrs of electricity. I will not allow anyone to pollute the air with generator fume.&#8221;</p>



<p>“I don’t want to hear Christianity, Muslim<br>separation comments or separation among<br>Nigerians because of tribe. We must all be<br>one,” Naira Marley said.</p>

<p>The trial of Azeez Fashola, popular musician also known as Naira Marley continued on January 27, 2021 with Justice Nicholas Oweibo of a Federal High Court, Ikoyi, Lagos admitting more evidence against him.</p>



<p>The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC is prosecuting Naira Marley for offence bordering on conspiracy and credit card fraud. He pleaded &#8220;not guilty&#8221; to the 11 counts filed against him.</p>



<p>The EFCC had on February 28, 2020, through its second witness, Augustine Anosike, sought to tender in evidence a compact disc containing information, analysis and extractions from the defendant’s iPhone. The defence counsel, Olalekan Ojo, SAN had objected to its admissibility, which was equally opposed to by the prosecution.</p>



<p>Delivering ruling today, Justice Oweibo dismissed the objection, noting that &#8220;the disk and investigation report include some of the contents extracted from the iPhone which has already been admitted in evidence&#8221;.</p>



<p>The trial judge thus admitted the evidence as Exhibit F.</p>



<p>Thereafter, prosecuting counsel, Bilikisu Buhari, informed the Court that the prosecution was ready to continue with the case as the witness was in court to continue with his testimony.</p>



<p>Akinwale Kole-Taiwo who appeared for the defence, however appealed with the Court for an adjournment because, &#8220;the lead counsel, Olalekan Ojo, SAN was in Edo for another matter&#8221;.</p>



<p>Following the appeal, Justice Oweibo adjourned till March 8 and 11, 2021 for &#8220;continuation of hearing&#8221;.</p>
