<p>The national grid reportedly experienced a fresh collapse in the early hours of Monday, April 15, throwing the country into total darkness.</p>



<p>This comes barely three weeks after the grid collapsed on Thursday, March 28, the fourth in 2024.</p>



<p>BusinessDay reports that data obtained from the Nigerian System Operator’s portal, reveals the grid recorded an unprecedented zero Megawatts (MW) at t about 2:00 am and is currently generating a meagre 52.3MW around 7:10 am the same day.</p>



<p>According to the report, the consequences of this blackout were felt nationwide, as electricity distribution companies (DisCos) struggled to cope with the sudden and prolonged outage.</p>



<p>This collapse marks the fifth grid disturbance in 2024, adding to challenges that have long plagued Nigeria’s power sector.</p>

<p>Nigerians have not had this before as it is now in term of Electricity supply in the country.</p>



<p>Despite huge amount of Many spend and continue been spend to give Nigerians steady power supply, almost every corner of the country is left with total darkness.</p>



<p>Just within the space of January to June 2022, Nigerian National grid has collapsed 17th times.</p>



<p>Despite all the collapsed and no supply of Electricity to Nigerian, the distribution company still go around collecting estimated bills from Nigerians.</p>
