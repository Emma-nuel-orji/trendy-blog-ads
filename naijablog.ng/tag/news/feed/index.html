<p>Microsoft is in talks to acquire TikTok, the immensely popular social media app known for its fun short-form videos, in a move that could prevent the Trump administration from banning it from the US, according to reports.</p>



<p>The Seattle tech giant founded by Bill Gates is in discussions to buy TikTok in a deal valued in the tens of billions, according to Fox Business. </p>



<p>The acquisition talks come as TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, has come under intense scrutiny by public officials concerned that the Chinese government is using the app to tap user data.</p>



<p>News of the talks come as Trump confirms that he’s looking at taking steps to ban the app in the US a move that Bloomberg reported could happen as soon as Friday.</p>



<p>“We’re looking at TikTok,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. “There are a couple of options but a lot of things are happening, so we’ll see what happens. But we are looking at a lot of alternatives with respect to TikTok.”</p>



<p>An acquisition would instantly turn Microsoft a hot tech name in the 1990s that is now primarily fueled by its massive cloud computing arm into one of the biggest names in social media.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">UAE&#8217;s first nuclear reactor at the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant has successfully started operations.</h3>



<p>The United Arab Emirates has become the first Arabian country to produce nuclear energy, following the start-up of a newly constructed nuclear power plant in Abu Dhabi.</p>



<p>The Barakah Nuclear Power Plant’s Unit 1 is now using nuclear fuel to produce energy after the facility successfully executed initial tests on Saturday. </p>



<p>Three other reactors are still under construction and the plant still needs to be connected to the country’s power grid, local media reported.</p>



<p><em>“Today we announce the UAE’s success in operating the first peaceful nuclear reactor in the Arab world,” </em>Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, ruler of Dubai, wrote on Twitter. </p>



<p>He added that “<em>the goal is to operate four nuclear power plants that will provide one-quarter of the country’s energy needs in a safe, reliable and emission-free way.”</em></p>



<p>Hamad Alkaabi, the UAE’s representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), described the plant’s initial launch as a “historic milestone” for his country. </p>



<p>The Dubai leader also said the plant’s launch illustrates that “the Arabs are able to resume their scientific ambitions” and hinted that the next step for the UAE is space exploration.</p>

<p>As the Edo governorship election day nears, appointees of Governor Godwin Obaseki have continued to resign on a weekly basis.</p>



<p>Many of those who dumped the governor are said to be staunch members of the All Progressives Congress (APC).</p>



<p>The number of resigned appointees has reached 42 and there are speculations that more will tender their resignation.</p>



<p>The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had fixed September 19 for the poll.</p>



<p>The governor defected when the APC disqualified him from participating in the primary.</p>



<p>Osagie Ize-Iyamu, the PDP candidate in 2016, emerged the APC flagbearer.</p>



<p>Obaseki, the APC candidate in 2016, had predicted the development.</p>



<p>He explained that his predecessor, Adams Oshiomhole, brought in Ize-Iyamu from the PDP just to settle scores.</p>



<p>Last week, Oshiomhole, ex-APC National Chairman, stated that he made a mistake supporting Obaseki to become Edo helmsman.</p>



<p>Obaseki was the Chairman, Edo State Economic and Strategy Team, when Oshiomhole was governor.</p>



<p>Currently, no fewer than 42 of his appointees have dropped their appointments.</p>



<p>Recent instances include Patrick Iyoha, Director of Obaseki/Shaibu Movement (OSM) and a member of the Waste Management Board.</p>



<p>Three members in the Edo State Oil and Gas Producing Area Development Commission (EDSOGPADEC) Board – Osamwonyi Atu, Emmanuel Odigie, and Rilwanu Oshiomhole, representing Edo-South, Edo-Central, and Edo-North respectively.</p>



<p>Two members, including Gabriel Oiboh, Chairman, State Post Primary Education Board, left too.</p>



<p>Former Chief of Staff, Taiwo Akerele was the first major appointee who resigned.</p>



<p>Paul Ohonbamu, Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, also bade Obaseki farewell.</p>



<p>Below is the full list of the 42 ex-appointees:</p>



<p>Taiwo Akerele – Chief of Staff</p>



<p>John Mayaki – Chief Press Secretary</p>



<p>Paul Ohonbamu – Commissioner</p>



<p>Omua Oni-Okpako – Commissioner</p>



<p>Monday Ogiegor – MD EDSTMA</p>



<p>Christopher Adesotu – Chairman, Vocational and Technical Education Board</p>



<p>Gabriel Oiboh – Chairman, Post Primary Education Board</p>



<p>Osanyemwere Osawe – Member, Post Primary Education Board</p>



<p>Fulani Yakubu Ekpeyoung – SSA</p>



<p>Adeyanju Noah – SSA</p>



<p>Cordelia M. Iyogun – SSA</p>



<p>James Osheku – SSA</p>



<p>Louis Osamuyi Osayande – SSA</p>



<p>Ernest Unuaghon imina – SSA</p>



<p>Prince Lucky Igbinedion – SSA</p>



<p>Chris Oseiwe Oribhabor – SSA</p>



<p>Solomon Okoduwa – SSA</p>



<p>Kennedy Itepu – SSA</p>



<p>Sabbath Egbeyon – SSA</p>



<p>Emike Obazee – SA</p>



<p>Goodluck A. Uyigue – SA</p>



<p>Razaq Rotimi – SA</p>



<p>Olajide Victor Oloruyomi – SA</p>



<p>Smart Bank – SA</p>

<p>Boyi Magdalene – SA</p>



<p>Osarobo Osaro Anthony – SA</p>



<p>Aibangbee Chico – SA</p>



<p>Obayagbona Augustine – SA</p>



<p>Osamwonyi Atu – EDSOGPADEC</p>



<p>Emmanuel Odigie – EDSOGPADEC</p>



<p>Rilwanu Oshiomhole – EDSOGPADEC</p>



<p>Okondoh Patrick Iyoha – OSM Director</p>



<p>Maureen Osaro Ekhoragbon – Vice-Chairman Ovia North-East</p>



<p>Aghedo Oscar – Secretary Ovia North-East</p>



<p>Kehinde Garrick Osemwingie – Secretary, Uhumwonde LGC</p>



<p>Otaniyen Igbinosa – Orhiomwon Supervisor</p>



<p>Martins Ozakpolor – Orhiomwon Supervisor</p>



<p>Vincent Ehibor – Orhiomwon Supervisor</p>



<p>However, Obaseki has boasted that the PDP will win the election by 75 percent.</p>

<p>Nollywood Actress, Ada Ameh has opined that being a feminist doesn’t mean you shouldn’t submit to your husband as she dropped her &#8216;two cents&#8217; on feminism.</p>



<p>She noted that although she is a feminist, she submits to her husband because that is the right thing to do as a woman. </p>



<p>She referenced her stance of submitting to the husband to the Bible because it teaches women to be submissive to their husbands.</p>



<p>She was asked about some regrets she had made in her life and she said she had no regrets in life.</p>



<p>She was engaged in an interview with The Sun and said that:</p>



<p> <em>&#8220;I can never regret having my child at 14. God forbid! The truth is that the ways of God are so different from the ways of man. </em></p>



<p>&#8220;<em>Just imagine me at this age if I am not married and don’t have a child. </em></p>



<p><em>I am not saying marriage is the ultimate but we both know what I am talking about.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Tension recently heightened in Jos city and Bukuru town in Plateau State over an alleged plan by some people to install an emir in Jos South Local Government Area of the state.</p>



<p>According to reports gathered by PunchNG, the tension arose when an invitation card purported to be from the Bukuru Emirate Council inviting the public to the inauguration of one Samaila Abdullahi as the Sarkin Kerana 4th of Bukuru Emirate on Saturday, August 1, 2020 at a location said to be the Palace of the Emir of Bukuru was circulated in Jos and other parts of the state.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/images-13.jpeg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-64087" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>A federal lawmaker representing Jos South/Jos East Constituency, Dachung Bagos, immediately alerted members of the public of plans by some people to cause a fresh crisis in the state using the emirate system.</p>



<p>Bagos, who described the move as an invitation to anarchy, said in a statement on Friday that no emirate system existed anywhere in his constituency.</p>



<p>He warned those nursing the ambition to create an emirate system in his constituency to give peace a chance and called on members of the public to disregard the invitation.</p>



<p>He said, <em>“My attention has been drawn to an invitation card purported to be from a non-existing Bukuru Emirate Council inviting the public to a turbaning ceremony inauguration of one Samaila Abdullahi as the Sarkin Kerana 4th of Bukuru Emirate on 1st August, 2020 at a location said to be the Palace of the Emir of Bukuru.”</em></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Facebook had previously closed deals with rights holders seeking permission to broadcast their official videos.</h3>



<p>Facebook has sealed partnership deals with music giants&nbsp; for the right to show music videos, according to sources close to management of the social networking site.</p>



<p>Sources who pleaded anonymity confirms that the deal is with the three largest music companies in the world; Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group and an announcement is expected to be made soon.</p>



<p>Music videos are one of the most popular genres on YouTube, and Facebook has long sought the legal rights to allow its billions of users to watch and share them on its platform.</p>



<p>Facebook had previously inked deals with rights holders in order to use the audio useful when people upload clips that include background music, for example, but didn’t have permission to show the official videos.</p>



<p>Facebook had in recent times approached some artists and music companies about acquiring exclusive rights to some music videos, even if just temporarily, sources said.</p>



<p>In some cases, Facebook has said it would be willing to pay the video production costs, and that it would promote the video on its service to increase viewership, they said.</p>



<p>Facebook has been looking for more ways to increase video consumption on its service, tapping into a promising market.</p>



<p>Video advertising is often more lucrative than other types of ads, and video-based rival TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, has been gaining users at a rapid clip.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">28-year-old Victoria Price says she &#8220;will forever be thankful&#8221; to the sharp-eyed member of the public, who encouraged her to see a doctor.</h3>



<p>A TV news reporter in the US has revealed how she found out she had cancer after a viewer sent her an email raising concern about a lump on her neck.</p>



<p>Victoria Price, a correspondent with NBC affiliate WFLA-TV in Tampa, Florida, said she was alerted last month by a sharp-eyed member of the public, who encouraged her to see a doctor.</p>



<p>The 28-year-old, who had been working at &#8220;full throttle&#8221; covering the coronavirus pandemic, was subsequently diagnosed with thyroid cancer.</p>



<p>The tumour had pushed the gland up and out causing a &#8220;subtle protrusion&#8221;.</p>



<p>She will now undergo surgery to remove the cancerous growth along with a couple of nearby lymph nodes.</p>



<p>Writing on her social media, Price said:</p>



<p>&#8220;As a journalist, it&#8217;s been full throttle since the pandemic began.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Never-ending shifts in a never-ending news cycle.</em></p>



<p><em>Adjusting to remote workflows and in my case, taking on a new investigative role.</em></p>



<p><em>&#8220;We were covering the most important health story in a century, but my own health was the farthest thing from my mind.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>She shared the email she received from the viewer which said: &#8220;Hi, I just saw your news report. What concerned me is the lump on your neck. Please have your thyroid checked.</p>



<p>&#8220;Reminds me of my neck. Mine turned out to be cancer. Take care of yourself.&#8221;</p>



<p>Following confirmation of the cancer, Price wrote:</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Doctor says it&#8217;s spreading, but not too much, and we&#8217;re hopeful this will be my first and last procedure.</em></p>



<p><em>&#8220;Had I never received that email, I never would have called my doctor.</em></p>



<p><em>&#8220;The cancer would have continued to spread. It&#8217;s a scary and humbling thought.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Price ended her post by saying she &#8220;will forever be thankful&#8221; to the viewer who emailed her.</p>



<p>&#8220;She had zero obligation to, but she did anyway. Talk about being on your side, huh? The world is a tough place these days.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget to take care of yourself. Take care of each other. Love y&#8217;all and see you soon,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Until recently thyroid cancer was the most rapidly increasing cancer in the US, according to the American Cancer Society.</p>



<p>This was largely due to increased detection with the use of more sensitive diagnostic techniques.</p>

<p>The Founder and Presiding Bishop of Living Faith Church Worldwide International aka Winners’ Chapel, Bishop David Oyedepo, has said the coronavirus pandemic is just the beginning of the woes to be visited on the world “before the Lord returns.”</p>



<p>However, quoting from Matthew 24: 7/8; Joel 2:1-3/11; Malachi 4:2 and Malachi 3:10/18; 4:1-3, Bishop Oyedepo noted that “everyone in the army of the Lord will manifest greatness in the thick darkness.”</p>



<p>He added that those growing while others burn are “in the covenant of financial fortunes” as captured in Mal 3:10, because “being in the covenant places a seed of exemption from the woes of the world on your life.”</p>



<p>The cleric was preaching on the topic “Gateways to Financial Fortunes (4)” during Sunday’s Financial Fortune Banquet service.</p>



<p>According to him, the covenant that can set anyone apart and protect from the worldly woes is “the covenant of giving and receiving”.</p>



<p>In his words:</p>



<p><em>“Just like when you stop breathing you start dying, when you stop giving, you start going down. Not just in finance, but in every area of your life. It is not something you do once and for all; it is a once and again covenant.”</em></p>



<p>Bishop Oyedepo also outlined the “vital keys to world financial fortunes” to include: be spiritually minded as prosperity cannot outgrow spirituality, and to engage tirelessly in covenant practice by making giving a lifestyle.</p>



<p>Others are walking in financial integrity, which he said is needed in the world now more than ever. He said where being a Christian used to mean integrity, today, people steal in the church.</p>



<p>He also added seeking continuous guidance so as not to run into a desert, commitment to thinking and speaking covenant-rooted words, and, finally, to “keep rejoicing to access your returns”.</p>

<p>The campaigns of Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Nigeria&#8217;s nominee for the position of the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, WTO, is fast gaining momentum as she has made it clear to position the organization in the right path.</p>



<p>Okonjo-Iweala made this known during a virtual interview on BBC&#8217;s &#8216;HardTalk Show&#8217;, where she discussed Gavi&#8217;s vital role in the global fight against Covid-19 and how the WTO cannot carry on with business as usual.</p>



<p>In her words on the live show;</p>



<p>The one time Nigeria&#8217;s Finance Minister made it known that the&nbsp; needs of the WTO at this time is not about the technical qualifications or technical negotiators, because if that&#8217;s what they needed they would have solved the problem long ago.</p>
