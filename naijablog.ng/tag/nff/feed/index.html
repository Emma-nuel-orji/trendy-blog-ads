<p>According to NAN, Nasir Idris, governor of Kebbi, led the commissioning of the facility, located on Kalgo Road in Birnin Kebbi, the state capital. The foundation of the mini stadium was laid in September 2020 by Atiku Bagudu, former governor of the state.</p>

<p>Speaking at the inauguration, Ibrahim Gusau, NFF president, said the federation will do more to provide facilities to improve the stadium’s standard further.<br />He promised more effort to improve sports development across the country.<br />“We are going to do more to increase the facilities for the stadium to be of standard than its now,” Gusau said.</p>



<p>“We are not going to let the youth down and I urge them to come back to help others that are coming up if they have the opportunities outside the country.”<br>The FIFA Forward programme also funds another mini stadium in Ugborodo, Delta State.</p>

<p>After Super Falcons lost 2-4 to South Africa in the final gamemof the Aisha Buhari Invitational in Lagos On Tuesday, NFF singled out Dijon of France based attacker, Desire Oparanozie for Criticism.</p>



<p>This is what they said in their first press release after the match:</p>



<p>&#8220;France-based forward Desire Oparanozie was most awful on the evening, squandering a half-dozen opportunities, easily conceding possession and literally playing against her own team.</p>



<p>&#8220;The bright lights for Nigeria as the climate became overcast in the second half were Gift Monday, Opeyemi Sunday and Vivian Ikechukwu, who all came into the game after half time and underscored boldly what youth might be able to speak to that the old guard might not.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ikechukwu, like a house on fire, fought for every ball across the park, turned in a sweet cross by fellow substitute Gift Monday only two minutes into the second period to give Nigeria some hope, and crashed a vicious shot into the top corner of goalkeeper Kaylin Swart’s goal in the 53rd minute as the arena rumbled.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Super Falcons created chance after chance, but Oparanozie wasted them all, choosing a big day to put every foot wrong, and shockingly, lasting the entire 90 minutes on the park.&#8221;</p>



<p>WHO DOES THAT?</p>

<p>English Premier League (EPL) club, Fulham who just promoted disclosed the signing of wing back Ola Aina on a season-long loan from Italian Serie A side Torino.</p>



<p>Fulham also have an option to make the 23-year-old’s arrival permanent and the Nigeria international said he was happy to return to London where he was born and raised.</p>



<p>“It feels amazing to be back closer to my family, back in the capital,” Aina told the club’s media channel.</p>



<p>“There’s a great bunch of lads here. I’m really good friends with Big Hec (Michael Hector) and Josh Onomah.”</p>



<p>Aina, who came through neighbouring Chelsea’s youth system, spent the last two seasons with Torino, where he played 69 times with his versatility allowing him to play on either flank.</p>



<p>“I feel very comfortable on either foot. I can fill in wherever needs be,” he added.</p>



<p>“I’d say I’m pretty quick and I like to attack, but I also like to help the team and do the dirty work as much as I can.”</p>



<p>Aina’s signing follows the capture of midfielder Harrison Reed, goalkeeper Alphonse Areola, right-back Kenny Tete and midfielder Mario Lemina and left-back Antonee Robinson.</p>



<p>Winger Anthony Knockaert’s loan move was also made permanent.</p>



<p>Fulham, who gained promotion to the Premier League after winning the second-tier Championship playoffs last season, begin their campaign on Saturday with a visit from fellow London side Arsenal.</p>

<p>Eucharia Uche, former head coach of the Super Falcons, has said that it is not possible for the women’s national team and their male counterparts, the Super Eagles to be receiving equal pay.</p>
<p>Brazil became the fourth country after Australia, Norway and New Zealand to pay their men and women’s national teams the same amount, on Thursday.</p>
<p>This has sparked different reactions in Nigeria, with many also advocating for equal pay for both teams.</p>
<p>However, Eucharia, who led the team to the African Women’s Cup of Nations victory in 2010 in South Africa, said that as good as the initiative was, it was impossible in the country at the moment.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it is possible for the Falcons to earn as much as what the Eagles get now,” Eucharia, who played for the women’s national team in the 1990s said.</p>
<p>“During my time as a player for the national team, what we got as match bonuses was what the U-23 men’s team were given.</p>
<p>When we complained to the then Secretary-General of the NFF, Alhaji Sani Toro, he made us understand that the Eagles would naturally earn more than the Falcons. Though for me as a person, it’s no problem.</p>
<p>This is my opinion, let everyone get what is due to them, but on a personal note, I don’t think we should be thinking about such things now. We have many other things to think of in the national team.”</p>

<p>Female footballers in Cross River State, the Pelican Stars have demonstratesld over non-payment of 14 months salaries. The players who laid wrappers at the gate of the Governor’s office vowed not to leave the gate until they are paid,</p>



<p>Captain of the team, Miss Hodo Williams who disclosed this on Wednesday on behalf of the team, said they would all remain at the entrance of the governor’s office and would not move unless they were paid.</p>



<p>We are owed 14 months salaries, this month inclusive and we will sleep at the entrance of the governor’s office unless we are addressed by Gov. Ben Ayade or his Deputy.</p>



<p>“We spoke to our chairman yesterday and it was still the same old story of we want to meet the governor to grant his final approval for you to be paid but we are tired of waiting from last year,” she said.</p>



<p>Also speaking, the Chairman of the Calabar based female football club, Mr Kombor Sam, said every recommendation as directed by the governor had been fulfilled and the papers sent to his office, what was left was his endorsement.</p>



<p>“I am also helpless because we have done all we were told to do, all we are waiting for now is the authorisation of payment and that only comes from the governor,” he said.</p>



<p>Reacting to the incident, the Commissioner for Sports Mr Offu Aya said the ministry had done all it was supposed to do and was awaiting the governor’s approval.</p>



<p>“We started the process of getting their money before the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) state Congress issues started which has taken the governor’s attention.</p>



<p>“All I know is that this congress will be concluded by Saturday, August 15, so, when it is concluded, they have no option than to pay the girls, the cash is there, I can attest to that, he said.</p>



<p>The players of the Pelican Stars Football Club had earlier protested in June over the same issue of unpaid salaries from May 2019, till date.</p>

<p>COVID-19 relief fund to the tune of $2m has been received by the Nigeria Football Federation from FIFA, CAF and sponsors.</p>
<p>Now, the NFF has announced the beneficiaries of the relief fund.</p>
<p>The Sports Writers Association of Nigeria, the Supporters Club, as well as Mascots, have all been captured in the breakdown of the planned distribution of the cash.</p>
<p>Due to the devastating effects of COVID-19, these funds are meant to serve as a booster for preparation ahead of the 2020/2021 League Season.</p>
<p>The total sum to be disbursed is made up of $1,000,000 (being FIFA’s support for restarting the football season); $500,0000 (being FIFA’s dedicated support for women’s football); $300,000 (CAF’s support to its Member Associations); $200,000 (NFF’s support from Sponsors’ Funds), as contained in a communiqué.</p>
<p>Part of the communiqué read,</p>
<p>“After consultations with the leadership of the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Board endorsed the proposal from the Secretariat for the lump sum of $2,000,000.00 (Two Million American Dollar Only) to be shared across the various Clubs and governing bodies of the various Leagues, viz Nigeria Professional Football League, Nigeria National League, Nigeria Women Football League and the Nigeria Nationwide League, as a booster for their preparation ahead of the 2020/2021 League Season”.</p>
<p>According to the breakdown, the men’s football division will get $1.5m (N579m) while the women folk will make do with just the $.5m (N193m) allocated to them from FIFA with no share in the extra funds gotten from sponsors and CAF.</p>
<p>SWAN (Sports Journalists) have been earmarked to receive $300,000 (over N11m) while the Supporters Club, presently with different factions, are pencilled for $25,000 (over N9m).</p>

<p>According to a close source, he was tested for coronavirus on his arrival.</p>



<p>“They tested him on his arrival and he wasn’t positive, he took the train to Bordeaux the same day”</p>



<p>However, the club announced a positive case among the players of Girondix Bordeaux days after Kalu returned but refuse to disclose the identity of the player for medical confidentiality</p>



<p>The Afcon 2019 bronze winner has been in isolation since the opening of camp and might be left out of some of the club’s pre-season games.</p>

<p>Amaju Pinnick, the President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has said that the football Federation will not beg Bukayo Saka to play for Nigeria.</p>
<p>Bukayo Saka is a player for Arsenal football club.</p>
<p>Pinnick said that the era of pleading with players to play for the national team is over. He stated that the country is blessed with talents and was emphatic about not begging 18 year old Bukayo Saka or any player to represent the Super Eagles.</p>
<p>In an Instagram live chat, Pinnick said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Saka is an excellent prospect but we have other players in his position who are playing so well.</p>
<p>We have talents everywhere so we won&#8217;t beg people to play for Nigeria.</p>
<p>It is about ardour and fervour, If it&#8217;s their desire and they merit it, they&#8217;ll be given a chance to represent Nigeria.&#8221;</p>
