<p>Governor Darius Dickson Ishaku has inaugurated task force team on counter trafficking of persons and smuggling of migrants, the team is led by the Attorney General state and Commisioner for justice Barr. Sam Ada. The team is saddled with the responsibility of looking into the cases of child trafficking and Smuggling of migrants in and out of the state.</p>



<p>The Governor in his remarks disclosed that it has become imperative to set up a task force team owing to the uprising in child trafficking and smuggling of migrants in and out of Taraba state. He described trafficking as a crime against humanity which could be traced back as far as slave trade days. He said the overall function of the task force is to coordinate with law enforcement agencies, NGOs and together work to save lives. He stated that with the constituting of the task force, human trafficking will be a thing of the past in Taraba state. Nelson C. Len</p>



<p>He disclosed that significant progress has been made on this areas but still has enough to push in bringing it to an overhaul. The Governor frowned against the practice of prostitution, ponography etc, acknowledging that these vises are pathways to triggering most of this act which are against humanity. He however warned with stem order against those who are into such practice saying government will not take it lightly with anyone found guilty of the mentioned crime. He charged the newly inaugurated members to put in their very best in discharging this assignment as though it were their personal assignment so as to end this menace of human trafficking that is gradually eating deep into our society.</p>



<p>He urged them to be committed to this as it is a service to humanity knowing that payment for such only comes from God almighty and that which comes from God is always the greatest. He finally called on every Taraban to be part of this fight in other to sanitise our dear state from this monsteriuos vise.</p>

<p>Niger State Government has demolished a buildings belonging to a suspected kidnapper in Yikangbe, a suburb of Minna, the state capital.</p>



<p>The structures comprise of a completed two bed room flat where he was occupying with his family members and another two bedroom flat yet to be completed.</p>



<p>The State Commissioner for Local Government, Community Development, Chieftaincy Affairs and Internal Security, Emmanuel Umar supervised the demolition which was carried out under the watchful eye of heavy security men of the Nigerian Police.</p>



<p>Speaking to Journalists, Mr Umar explained that a good citizen of the state gave the security agents vital information about the supecious activities of the suspect which led to his arrest and subsequent demolition of the apartment.</p>



<p>The Commissioner said the suspect has since been taken to Abuja for further investigations.</p>



<p>He assured citizens of the state that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello is determined to protect lives and property and rid off the state of criminal elements.</p>



<p>The Commissioner stressed that government will not allow the state to be a safe haven for kidnappers and bandits pointing out that the same thing will be carried out on any property that is established to have been acquired by proceeds of kidnapping, banditry or other forms of criminality in the state.</p>



<p>&#8220;What you are seeing behind is a proceed of crime.</p>



<p>&#8220;The building is owned by a kidnapper that has been arrested and since it is our policy not to allow criminality reign in the state, the law enforcement agencies in partnership with the state government are so happy to have established this&#8221;, he said</p>



<p>While commending the efforts of the security agencies, the commissioner also appreciated those who provided useful information that led to the arrest of the suspect.</p>



<p>He encouraged the people to always be vigilante and report to security agents any suspicious activities around their vicinity assuring them that the information will be treated with confidentiality.</p>



<p>Inuwa Makun and Tanko Ibrahim who are Ward Heads of Yikangbe and Kpakungu respectively, commended the efforts of the state government and security agencies promising that the people of the communities will be more security conscious.</p>



<p>Some residents of the area who were shocked by the development, said the arrested kidnapper moved into the neighbourhood two months ago after he bought the property.</p>

<p>The Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), through the singular efforts of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello, has approved the disbursement of a US$86.64 Million loan to Niger State Government for the construction and upgrading of the 82-kilometer Minna-Bida road being handled by Dantata and Sawoe Company.</p>



<p>The Board of Executive Directors of the Bank gave the approval of the loan at its 341st meeting held on the sidelines of the IsDB Group Board of Governors&#8217; 2021 Annual General Meeting in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.</p>



<p>The Board approved funds totalling US$110.14 Million for three new development projects in Infrastructure, Water and Sanitation as well as Education to be executed in Nigeria (Niger State), Guinea and Sierra Leone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fb_img_16325968917417927942814910395894.jpg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-96477" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>The upgrading of the Minna-Bida Road Project, which already in progress, is expected to contribute to the socioeconomic development of the state through the establishment of safe, efficient and cost-effective interconnections not only between Local Government Areas in the state but also amongst States of the Northern and South Western parts of the country.</p>



<p>Governor Abubakar Sani Bello, in a statement, appreciated with gratitude effort of the IsDB for the timely approval of the funds stressing that it will hasten the completion of the road project according to specifications and on schedule.</p>



<p>The Governor reiterated that the 82-kilometer Minna-Bida Road Project, on completion, will reduce travel time, vehicle operating costs, road maintenance cost, improved traffic flow as well as increased road safety.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fb_img_16325968831994177183065072614381.jpg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-96476" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>Recall that the government of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello, in 2019, make bold its promise to dualize the Minna-Bida Road which had been in the worst state of disrepair for some time.</p>

<p>Nger State Goverment has evacuated its citizens that are schooling in the University of Jos, Plateau State, back to the state following the breach of peace in some parts of the state which resulted in loss of lives, maiming and destruction of properties.</p>



<p>The state government said the action became necessary as the security situation has compelled the University Management to suspend the Second Semester Examinations for 2019/2020 Academic Session of the institution.</p>



<p>Worried about the wellbeing of her citizens and for them not to be left stranded as well as become victims of circumstances, the state government through the Commissioners for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs as well as Tertiary Education, Science and Technology, made arrangements for vehicles and security personnel to ensure safe evacuation and return of the students.</p>



<p>The state government reiterated its unwavering commitment to the safety of its citizens irrespective of their geopolitical locations.</p>



<p>Mary Noel-Berje<br />Chief Press Secretary<br />to the Governor of Niger State</p>

<p>Niger State Government has warned, in strong term, that it would not condone any acts of thuggery, lawlessness and unrest in Minna, the state capital been perpetrated as a result of community clashes between and among some erring youths.</p>



<p>Governor Abubakar Sani Bello in a statement, said anybody who causes disequilibrium or is intending to forment trouble in the state would not be spared by the clutching fist of the law.</p>



<p>Irate youths within Minna the state capital were, on Friday, said to have engaged themselves in communal clashes that left several persons injured creating anxiety and fears among the peaceful residents.</p>



<p>The Governor said the hoodlums must accept to live in peace, stop violent attacks on each other and ensure peaceful coexistence among themselves or face the full wrath of the law.</p>



<p>&#8220;These communal youth clashes are becoming notoriously disturbing in Minna, and we will not fold our arms and watch it degenerate. Government will continue to improve on and protect the security of lives and property of the people&#8221;.</p>



<p>Accordingly, Governor Sani Bello directed the security agencies to comb the nook and cranny of the state capital and apprehend those restive youths who want to take laws into their hands.</p>



<p>He said normalcy have been restored in the affected areas and urged residents to go about their legitimate businesses without any fear of harassment and intimidation as any form of lawlessness would be repelled.</p>



<p>While assuring that it would soon unfold more youths engagement schemes to create jobs, the Governor disclosed that government is also fighting the menace of drug abuse and proliferation which is possibly enablers of the incessant youth clashes in the state capital.</p>
