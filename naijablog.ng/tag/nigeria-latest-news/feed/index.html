<p>Nigeria, Africa&#8217;s biggest oil producer and exporter, has resumed importation of petrol from China, the world&#8217;s top crude oil importer.</p>



<p>The Asian country shipped 37,000 metric tonnes of petrol to Nigeria in September for the first time since July 2019, data from the General Administration of Customs showed, according to S&amp;P Global Platts.</p>



<p>Nigeria has continued to rely heavily on importation for many years to meet its fuel needs as the nation&#8217;s refineries remain in a state of disrepair.</p>

<p>Abdulrahman Bahsar, the Group Managing Director of Rahamaniyya Oil and Gas has said that he is committed to and will honor the agreement between his firm and Sahara Energy.</p>
<p>The agreement of the two organisations is about the buying and selling of 15,000MT Gasoil deals in 2018.</p>
<p>In response to a report that he had defaulted in the agreement and sentenced by a London Court, Bashar clarified that an Agreement was reached between Ultimate Oil &amp; Gas, Sahara Energy &amp; Rahamaniyya Oil &amp; Gas on a payment plan for balance of cargo dues owed to Sahara Energy to be effected between Dec 2019 and 31 Jun 2020.</p>
<p>He spoke through his legal adviser, Dada Awosika in a statement issued in Abuja on Thursday.</p>
<p>He said that as part of the agreement, Sahara would relinquish claim over cargo return while Rahamaniyya would withdraw proceedings against Sahara in Nigerian court. He said,</p>
<p>“In the above mentioned case, we wish to clarify that such claims are false, harmful and misleading, as both firms mate today at Sahara Energy Corporate office in Abuja to strengthen their mutual business relationships as attached photographs.</p>
<p>Finally, we wish to state that the relationship between the firms remain cordial and we are up to date with our contractual business agreement.</p>
<p>Bashar is a law abiding citizen who remains free based out of his home in Abuja, Nigeria.”</p>

<p>Nasir El-Rufai, the governor of Kaduna State has blamed the killings in the southern part of the state on bandits.</p>
<p>He believes that contrary to ethno-religious motives which have been blamed, the bloodshed should be attributed to thieves.</p>
<p>Over the years, many lives have been lost in Southern Kaduna as a result of the many attacks on rural communities.</p>
<p>The attacks have been attributed to religious and ethnic motives, with Muslim Fulani youths usually blamed for an alleged genocidal campaign against the predominantly Christian population of the region.⁣</p>
<p>While speaking during an interview on Thursday, El-Rufai said the main cause of the recent attacks is banditry.⁣</p>
<p>&#8220;However, when it comes to Southern Kaduna as I said, it&#8217;s given a completely different interpretation.⁣</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing like land-grabbing because not one person can give an instance of any community that has been displaced, and totally occupied by these bandits,&#8221; he said.⁣</p>
<p>El-Rufai appealed to Kaduna residents to live peacefully with one another and resolve disputes through lawful means.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Dr Mercy Uwakwe Foundation distributes food materials worth millions of Naira</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62024" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Abia-state-1-1.jpg?resize=461%2C461&#038;ssl=1" alt="Abia State : Dr Mercy Uwakwe Foundation distributes food materials worth millions of Naira" width="461" height="461" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Bende, Abia State received a breath of fresh air as an NGO, Dr Mercy Uwakwe Foundation shut down the town and distributed food materials worth millions of Naira.</p>
<p>A Facebook user, Nneka Beatrice Jacob took to her Facebook page to tell of how the people of Bende were blessed by the kind gesture of the organisation.</p>
<p>Read her :</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a day filled with much fanfare and appreciation as all and sundry came from different places to partake in the 3rd Mercy Wave Palliative Outreach in Bende, Abia State.</p>
<p>For a lot of Bende Indigenes who have had to struggle just to make ends meet, taking multiple loans just to put food on the table, 17th July was a day to remember.</p>
<p>Dr Mercy Uwakwe&#8217;s Foundation, in her usual mandate of undiluted philanthropy, stormed the City with bags of rice, cartoons of noodles, bags of beans as well as other ingredients needed to make stable meals at least for the next few months.</p>
<p>In an event which was covered by our world class Mercy Wave TV Crew, practically all Bende indigenes, from all 13 wards of the Local Government, were at the Bende Local Government Headquarters, venue for the palliative outreach, as early as 9am and we did not disappoint.</p>
<p>Over three hundred Bende families, spread across all the 13 wards, received various food materials, while several other families from neighboring communities who were able to get to the venue of the event also got some for their efforts.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Mercy Wave TV Crew, several beneficiaries praised the magnitude of the outreach this time, pointing out that no one had ever reached out to all 13 wards simultaneously in a pioneer event that would be written down in history, one recipient broke down in tears while saying several words of prayer for our principal, Dr Mercy Seaphrora Uwakwe.</p>
<p>The mandate of feeding all 13 wards of Bende which was duly publicized was met with aplomb and everyone rejoiced at such show of humanitarian service by the CEO of Dr Mercy Uwakwe Foundation.</p>
<p>Indeed plaudits have been flowing in from all angle ever since, and the Dr Mercy Uwakwe, in her usual biblical mandate, has already started asking the question of how much more can I do to help, be rest assured that many more palliative outreaches have already been lined up and will be announced in due time.</p>
<p>With the persistence of the corona pandemic and a subsequent closure or restriction of various economic means, most Nigerians are finding it difficult to keep up with their feeding demand.</p>
<p>The 3rd Mercy Wave outreach, following two other successful outreaches, comes timely enough to alleviate to a large extent the needs of the Bende community, and for other communities, we will be coming to your doorsteps very soon.</p>
<p>The CEO, Princess Dr. Mercy Uwakwe, a rare gem in philanthropy and humanitarian services, once again proved her love and her committed actions to help as many families as possible in this dire times.</p>
<p>The continued push by her group, to always be at the forefront of emancipation for the poor and needy, is one that is commendable.</p>
<p>It is safe to assume, and rather correctly, that we have not seen the last of these line of wonderful acts by the Mercy Wave Conglomerate.</p>
<p>With other various forms of empowerment schemes being sponsored by the group, including but not restricted to scholarships, cash prize awards, Mercy Uwakwe Youth Empowerment Scheme(MUYES) and a host of others, we are witnessing a new dawn in humanitarian services in the country which will remain unrivaled for a long time to <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62025" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Abia-state-3.jpg?resize=678%2C453&#038;ssl=1" alt="Abia State : Dr Mercy Uwakwe Foundation distributes food materials worth millions of Naira" width="678" height="453" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62026" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Abia-state-4.jpg?resize=678%2C453&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="678" height="453" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62027" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Abia-state-2.jpg?resize=678%2C453&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="678" height="453" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62028" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Abia-state-7.jpg?resize=631%2C945&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="631" height="945" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62029" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Abia-state-8.jpg?resize=678%2C453&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="678" height="453" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62030" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Abia-state-5.jpg?resize=678%2C453&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="678" height="453" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62031" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Abia-state-6.jpg?resize=678%2C453&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="678" height="453" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62032" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Abia-state-30.jpg?resize=678%2C453&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="678" height="453" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62033" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Abia-state-9.jpg?resize=678%2C453&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="678" height="453" data-recalc-dims="1" />.&#8221;</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60987" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/11-females-.jpg?resize=421%2C315&#038;ssl=1" alt="NAF - 11 female officers training to become pilots" width="421" height="315" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>11 female officers are training to become pilots, the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, has revealed.</p>
<p>He said that the training programmes are currently going on both within and outside the country, and said that the Nigerian Air Force is committed to empowering its female officers just as it empowers their male counterparts.</p>
<p>The CAS made this known on Friday when he received federal cabinet members who came to condole with him over the unfortunate demise of Nigeria’s first female combat helicopter pilot, Flying Officer Tolulope Arotile.</p>
<p>A statement by NAF spokesperson, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, partly read,</p>
<p>“The CAS noted that Flying Officer Arotile had left her mark in the sands of time which he said proves that when it comes to displaying excellence and adding value to the society, age or gender should not be barriers.</p>
<p>He disclosed that the NAF would, therefore, continue to give equal opportunities to female officers in terms of training, noting that a total of 11 female student pilots were currently undergoing flying training both within and outside Nigeria.”</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60983" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Soldiers-.jpg?resize=436%2C344&#038;ssl=1" alt="Soldiers burn down houses, school in Taraba" width="436" height="344" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Reports reaching us have it that Soldiers have allegedly burned down a school and some houses in Peva town.</p>
<p>Peva town is a community in Takum Local Government Area of Taraba State.</p>
<p>According to the residents of the town, many people fled after the attacks and the burning of property belonging to some members of the community.</p>
<p>A resident identified as Nathan Tyozenda said that a school belonging to a businessman in the community named Prince Paul Gaza, was burnt in the early hours of Saturday.</p>
<p>He added that houses belonging to the Chairman of Peva Yam market, Mr. Orhemba, Mr. Iermber Vaatyough, and Prince Iordye Gaza, were burnt by the personnel of Operation Whirl Stroke in the town.</p>
<p>Hon. Peter Suleagbough, the Chairman of Tiv Cultural and Social Association in Takum Local Government Area, decried the incessant attacks and destruction of people’s property in the area.</p>
<p>He said that Gberifan and Tse-Iorver villages were also burnt in a similar manner by the soldiers.</p>
<p>“If they are looking for criminals as they say, why burn down people’s property?</p>
<p>What has a private school and people’s houses got to do with criminals.</p>
<p>The army should be arresting the criminals they are looking for and not burning people’s properties,” he said.</p>
<p>However, when the Commander of Operation Whirl Stroke, Major General Adeyemi Yekini was contacted, he said that the Director Defense Information at the Force headquarters was the right person to respond to media inquiries.</p>
<p>Yekini said,</p>
<p>“The Nigerian Army was a responsible force that acted mainly on intelligence and would not just burn down people’s properties.”</p>

<p>The face of the suspected killer of Fahim Saleh has been revealed. He is the former personal assistant of the Gokada CEO.</p>
<p>He has been arrested for the gruesome murder of Fahim Saleh in his $2.2m luxury New York penthouse.</p>
<p>The Police said that the suspect, 21 year old Tyrese Devon Haspil, attacked and killed Saleh on Monday.</p>
<p>They alleged that he made use of the deceased&#8217;s credit card to buy cleaning supplies. Then, he returned to the New York apartment on Tuesday where he dismembered him.</p>
<p>However, he stopped and escaped through the back staircase when Saleh&#8217;s sister came unexpectedly to the flat to check on her brother when he didn&#8217;t pick her calls.</p>
<p>The Police think that Haspil murdered Saleh to avoid paying back the tens of thousands of dollars he stole from the tech entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It was gathered that Saleh had found out his PA had stolen from him. Rather than reporting him to the authorities, he terminated his employment and set up a repayment plan for Haspil to pay him back.</p>
<p>However, Haspil chose to kill him. Police think this was the motive for the murder.</p>

<p>#SaveNigerianStudents hash tag is trending on Twitter by the Nigerian students over the decision of the Federal government on the reopening of schools.</p>
<p>They are saying that since markets, places of worship, airports and banks are open, as well as elections conducted, there&#8217;s no reason why schools should not be opened.</p>
<p>In addition, they are planning to hold a peaceful protest as well. See slides for more details</p>
