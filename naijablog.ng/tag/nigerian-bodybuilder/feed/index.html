<p>Nigerian bodybuilder dies after being shot by his wife during a disagreement in the U.S.</p>



<p>A US-based Nigerian bodybuilder, Michael Chidozie, has died weeks after his wife shot him multiple times at their apartment in Houston, Texas.</p>



<p>The 26-year-old died last week after his wife Keaiirra Shavoiyae Chidozie, 28, shot him four times in front of their kids in their home on March 21, 2024.</p>



<p>DailyMail reports that the deceased was rushed to Ben Taub Hospital after police found him with gunshot wounds and his wife in a panic holding their two kids, aged three and two.</p>



<p>Chidozie lingered on life support as his family prayed for his recovery, but he suffered a devastating spinal injury and di£d of complications 18 days later.</p>



<p>According to the report, Keaiirra was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after the shooting, and her charges have not been upgraded since his death.</p>



<p>She claimed to have shot Chidozie in self-defense as she feared for her life during the argument when he followed her into their bedroom. It’s unclear what the argument was over.</p>



<p>The argument began elsewhere in the house before she went to the bedroom, where she picked up a pistol and shot him.</p>



<p>Chidozie was shot once in the arm, once in the chest, and twice in his torso and left to di£ on the bedroom floor.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Keaiirra was released on bail and is set to next face court on May 23. Their children are being cared for by other family.</p>
