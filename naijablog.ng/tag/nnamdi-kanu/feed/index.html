<p>It seem that President Ahmed Bola Tinubu government is not ready to free the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB Nnamdi Kanu as today court sitting quashed his Acquittal and order his trial for treason and terrolism.</p>



<p>The development is coming today morning after the court upheld federal government treason and terrolism charge against the castrated IPOB leader.</p>



<p>Kanu who is demanding for the republic of Biafra for Igbos speaking tribes of Nigeria, was arrested and brought back to Nigeria few years back, after he narrowly escaped from his house following federal government force visit.</p>



<p>The visit where said to have cost many life.</p>



<p>Recently, before today sitting, IPOB write open letter to President Tinubu, to free Nnamdi Kanu if his agenda is not about ethnic cleansing.</p>



<p>However today judgment has proven that the government will not free the detained separatist leader.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The global family and movement of the Indigenous People of Biafra IPOB ably led by our Supreme leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu wish to draw the attention of the Nigeria government headed by President Ahmed Bola Tinubu that he and his government have the opportunity to prove to Ndigbo that he is not pursuing an ethnic cleansing agenda by releasing Mazi Nnamdi KANU from illegal detention by the DSS in the coming days or through the pronouncement of the Apex Court of Nigeria.</p>



<p>Ndigbo at home and diaspora are waiting to welcome Mazi Nnamdi Kanu home this December for the Christmas celebration. Whether Nigeria believes it or not, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is the face of Biafra, and Ndigbo nation. His pains are the pains of Biafra, and his joy is the joy of Biafra. The only people who despise Mazi Nnamdi Kanu are the criminals, the kidnappers, the insecurity profiteers, the enemies of peace, and all the enemies of Biafran nation and even Nigeria. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu controls millions of followers across the globe. His lovers and supporters will be very happy if the government of President Tinubu releases him unconditionally on or before the 15th of December 2023.</p>



<p>It will be ironic that the Nigerian President Ahmed Bola Tinubu and the Supreme Court Justices will hide under the pretence that some interested persons do not want Mazi Nnamdi Kanu released or hide under the bogus claims of National security risk as an excuse not to release MaziNnamdiKanu. As long as the world is concerned, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is not a national security threat to Nigeria. He and IPOB have been peaceful, and that is why more than 100 Nations of the world authorized the IPOB movement in their countries. Moreso, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has not committed any crime known to law anywhere, nor has any IPOB member been convicted of any crime in any Nigeria Court. We keep reminding the Nigeria government and the international community of the consequences of condoning ethnic cleansing and persecution of Ndigbo because we call for Biafra&#8217;s self-determination.</p>



<p>The eyes of the world are on the Supreme Court Justices of Nigeria. Not only Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will be on trial on December 15, 2023, but the Nigeria Supreme Court, UN law on Self-determination, African Charter on Human and People&#8217;s Right, and International laws on Extradition will also be on trial. The Nigeria Supreme Court will either save the Nigeria Judiciary&#8217;s battered image by going by the rule of law on December 15, 2023 or bend to the pressure from men of selfish interest and slide Nigeria into anarchy by endorsing illegality and keeping Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in detention.</p>



<p>Moreso, if President Ahmed Bola Tinubu allows himself to be used by saying some people from the Southeast advised him not to release Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, that means he has outsourced his authority and lacks power as the President of Nigeria.</p>



<p>Mazi Nnamdi Kanu deserves to be a free man after the Abuja Federal Court of Appeal discharged and acquitted him. The same Appeal Court barred the federal government of Nigeria from arresting or prosecuting him any longer in any court in Nigeria. The then lawless government refused to obey the Appeal Court Orders. Instead, they appealed and got a black market stay of execution. We hope that the Nigeria&#8217;s Supreme Court Justices will <em>not</em> ignore the government&#8217;s disobedience to Appeal Court Orders during their judgment to prove their honor and Independence. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and IPOB members have never committed any crime known to law locally or internationally.</p>



<p>The Supreme Court Justices should do Nigeria and themselves a favor by releasing Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Posterity will be kind to the Justices, who will do the needful and release Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, a prisoner of conscience. The release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will restore peace in the Eastern Region and give joy to Ndigbo and all Biafrans. But, his continuous persecution and illegal detention will further endanger the safety and security of Nigeria and, in particular, the entire Biafran territory. Biafrans at home and diaspora are keenly awaiting and watching the Supreme Court Justices.</p>



<p>COMRADE EMMA POWERFUL, MEDIA, AND PUBLICITY SECRETARY FOR IPOB.</p>

<p>Court sitting in Abuja, today Tuesday 28th of June 2022 strike out fresh application against the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, filed to be released on bail, pending the determination of the treasonable felony charge the Federal Government preferred against him.</p>



<p>Kanu, who is currently facing a seven-count charge, had in the application he filed through his team of lawyers led by Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, equally challenge the revocation of the bail the court earlier granted to him.</p>



<p>He specifically urged the court to set aside the order it made on March 28, 2019, which not only issued a bench warrant for his arrest, but also gave FG the nod to try him in absentia.</p>



<p>The IPOB leader told the court that contrary to FG’s allegation that he jumped bail, he said that he fled for his life after his home town at Afaraukwu Ibeku in Umuahia, Abia State, was invaded by soldiers, which he said led to the death of 28 persons.</p>



<p>Contending that he was denied fair hearing before his bail was revoked, Kanu, attached eight exhibits that included photographs, as well as an affidavit he deposed to from Isreal after he fled from the country.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, dismissing the bail request on Tuesday, trial Justice Binta Nyako, said she was not satisfied with the reason the IPOB leader gave for his failure to appear in court for continuation of his trial.</p>



<p>The trial judge noted that frok records of the court, Kanu, was represented by his lawyer on the day his bail was revoked, likewise his sureties.</p>



<p>“In fact, he sureties told the court that they did not know the whereabout of the Defendant and even applied to be discharged from the matter.</p>



<p>“Therefore, the Defendant was not denied fair hearing”.</p>



<p>Besides, Justices Nyako held that though a court could vacate a previous order when confronted with a cogent and verifiable reason, “in the instant case, I have not been given any, neither have I been given any reason to set-aside the order.</p>



<p>“The present application amounts to an abuse of court process for attempting to relitigate an issue already decided by the court.</p>



<p>“If the Defendant is dissatisfaction, he has the Appeal Court to go to.</p>



<p>“This application is accordingly dismissed”, Justice Nyako held.</p>



<p>It will be recalled that the court had also on March 18, declined to release the embattled IPOB leader on bail.</p>



<p>The court maintained that Kanu must explain the reason why he breached the previous bail that was given to him, before he could enjoy another favourable discretion from it.</p>



<p>“Until the issue of the absence of the defendant for his trial, with all the bail conditions breached, is determined, the instant application of the defendant for bail will at best be premature and it is refused.</p>



<p>“However, the defendant is at liberty to re-file the application”, Justice Nyako added.</p>

<p>Detained Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has demanded immediate stoppage of the senseless killings going on in the South East.</p>



<p>The IPOB Leader who spoke from the Department of State Services, DSS, detention in Abuja where he is currently detained expressed rage over the spate of bloodletting and insecurity in the South East.Kanu’s younger brother, Prince Emmanuel Kanu who spoke with Vanguard Monday evening, after visiting the IPOB Leader in detention said he was saddened by the reports of Killings across South East.</p>



<p>He said that his brother “does not believe in bloodshed” and felt too bad that blood suckers had been on the prowl in the South East almost unchallenged.Kanu was quoted as saying that all those behind the current killings in South East must be held accountable for their atrocities, saying that Ndigbo are not known for cannibalism.</p>



<p>The IPOB Leader also demanded the immediate release of Mrs Ukamaka Ejezie popularly known as ‘ Mama Biafra’.According to him the septuagenarian was arrested during Kanu’s last court appearance in Abuja on May 18.</p>



<p>Kanu said that the woman had been acting as his mother since his parents died in 2020.<br />He said that the old woman commited no crime for coming to Abuja to solidarise with him at the court when she was arrested.</p>



<p>” I saw her at the DSS detention cell after her clothes were washed and spread on the wall.. I demand that she be released because she commited no crime.</p>



<p>” She is an old woman and since my mother died I have taken her as my mother. The DSS should release her”, Kanu was quoted as saying</p>



<p>The IPOB Leader also cleared the air over whether he was the one that Gov. Chukwuma Soludo of Abambra State met when he visited the DSS headquarters last week.</p>



<p>He said that there was no basiis for people to doubt whether he was the person that Soludo met, explaining that the Barcelona club attire he wore when the Governor visited was his night wear</p>



<p>Kanu urged all to ensure there is peace in South East which is known for peace, adding that those behind the insecurity in the zone do not mean well for the people.</p>
