<p>The National President of the Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN), Emeka Rollas has reportedly been mocked by the abductors of the two Nollywood actors, Cynthia Okereke and Clemson Cornel over the ransom raised thus far.</p>



<p>The abductors mocked him on Monday, August 1, when he told them that N1.2 million has been raised rather than the $100,000 demanded.</p>



<p>Rollas stated that the kidnappers ordered other Nollywood stars to contribute towards paying the $100,000 ransom.</p>



<p>He said, “This is to brief you about the happenings over five days now on our two colleagues abducted a few days back. The situation still remains the same but we are believing God to do His miracles and wonders at this point in time.</p>



<p>Yesterday, while talking to the abductors, we were trying to explain to them that we were putting some funds together, we were contributing. We said that we had about N1.2 million. And they started laughing at us.</p>



<p>They started mocking us and saying ‘all those your celebrities posting on Instagram, how much have they contributed?’ Immediately, it got to me that these people are watching us. It is not the best time to circulate this information on Instagram.”</p>

<p>Actress and Communications director of the Actors Guild of Nigeria, Monalisa Chinda Coker, has said that the numbers of the kidnappers of two actors can be traced.</p>



<p>Two actors, Cynthia Okereke and Clemson Cornel, were abducted in Enugu on Friday.</p>



<p>The abductors have been in touch with the families of the victims and demanded $100,000 ransom.</p>



<p>Lamenting the ransom, Chinda Coker said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand how people would think that actors have money, with the paltry sum we receive as fees? The struggle through life vicissitudes, health issues etc we face every now n then???<br />$100k from where?</p>



<p>&#8220;The numbers that were used to communicate with them can easily be traced…I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nollywood actor, Kenneth Okonkwo, has resigned his membership of the All Progressives Congress over the choice of Kashim Shettima as the running mate of the party&#8217;s presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu.</p>



<p>He revealed this in a letter shared on his Instagram page on Monday.</p>



<p>Part of the letter read, “Recall that joined APC because of its Constitutional vow, as true Progressives and Patriots, to eliminate all forms of discrimination and social injustice in Nigeria…</p>



<p>“Those ideals are now alien to the APC, with their unfortunate decision to paint our Muslim brothers in had light, by insinuating that the Muslims in Nigeria will not accept or vote for a Northern Christian as Vice-President to pair with a Southern Muslim. If Muslims could vote voluntarily for Southern Christian Presidents, it is then a fallacy to insinuate that they cannot accept a Northern Christian Vice-President. This will permanently destroy the political viability of Northern Christians in Nigeria, if allowed to stand.”</p>

<p>Nollywood actress Chinedu Bernards aka Chii has passed away.</p>



<p>According to a source, she died after she slumped in a church in Enugu State on Friday, April 28. “I’m shaking as I type this. Chii was an ex-girlfriend to a popular actor. The whole of Nollywood knew she was the girlfriend to this actor before he went ahead to marry someone else.</p>



<p>She recently attended her colleague, Iheme Nancy’s mum’s burial and even spoke to her yesterday before her death.</p>



<p>She left a cryptic post after she heard the news of her boyfriend’s marriage to her colleague and later deleted it before her death. We heard she went to clean a church in Enugu State where she fell and by the time she was brought to the hospital, she was confirmed dead.</p>



<p>Her death is shocking to those of us in the industry who knew her. This is the strangest thing I’ve seen. The Nollywood industry is in mourning over her demise,” a source said.</p>

<p>An advice he claims will help checkmate some ills in the society and heal the land.</p>



<p>According to the director, social media influencers need to be cautioned from influencing products that they do not use personally.</p>



<p>Ugezu said, “One of the many ways to start healing our land. Let it be made a criminal offence for influencers to boldly influence people to use what they are not using. This, in my considered view, will checkmate many things.”</p>
