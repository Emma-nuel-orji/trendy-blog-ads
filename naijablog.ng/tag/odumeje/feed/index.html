<p>In his early morning address, Governor Charles Soludo of Anambra State said:</p>



<p>Let me sincerely appreciate ndị Anambra for understanding with us as we take audacious steps towards making our Homeland Liveable and Prosperous. On this journey, imperfect steps will be taken, emotions will run wild and opinions will grow thick.</p>



<p>What is pertinent to note is that we shall remain undaunted, correct our imperfections, strive to put our emotions in check and aggregate opinions that are in the interest of our overall good.</p>



<p>Yesterday&#8217;s outing has evoked emotions, not against the decision of government, but the imperfect and unprofessional manner with which one of the task force members discharged his lawful duty. This is highly regretted, and would never happen again. I have instructed that the task force personnel involved in the manhandling of Prophet Chukwuemeka Ohanaemere (Odumeje) be treated in accordance with the rules of public conduct which he roundly failed to uphold.</p>



<p>We will continue to work to actualize the mandate you have given to us. Nothing short of the best outcomes is guaranteed. On behalf of the government and good people of Anambra State, I condemn the assault, and further ask for your continued support in the fight to restore the dignity of Onitsha, and indeed the totality of our Homeland.</p>



<p>CC. Soludo, CFR</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nollywood actor, Zubby Michael criticized those who insinuated that he had obtained spiritual powers from the controversial Nigerian cleric Odumeje.In recent times, some videos have circulated on social networks, showing the popular actor dancing and jumping with Odumeje, while the latter continues with his release and his prophecies.This had sparked rumors that the actor was one of the pastor&#8217;s church members.However, Zubby has now taken to his page on social media to clarify and lash out at those who claimed they were spreading false claims that he had obtained spiritual powers for his success in Nollywood.According to him, Odumeje had once honored his opening party by distributing more than N1million in cash, returning the gesture by giving N500,000 during the pastor&#8217;s birthday party.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The lion, Odumeje. Where is he leading you all? You guys can enjoy all the drama but I hate it when you say, ‘that’s where Zubby got powers from, he made Zubby successful’,” Zubby explained.“Are you sick? The thunder that will fire those making such claims will come from Adamawa! I’m not denying he’s my friend way back from Onitsha. But does that mean I go there to pray?“Odumeje is my guy, not my pastor. Don’t be stupid. I don’t go to church. I’m more of a spiritual person than a religious. So I hate it when you tag me in your unnecessary drama.“Especially Tunde Ednut. Are you stupid? Why are you promoting unnecessary drama? Don’t you see what others promote? You’re a fool. I’m saying this because of my fans.“Odumeje is my guy; during my house warming, he came and sprayed one point something million. He invited me during his birthday, I went there sprayed N500k.“But, because of that, people are already making false claims. Stop that nonsense. He’s my friend, not my pastor. If you want me in your own show, then pay me and I’ll definitely come.”</p></blockquote>
