<h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Pedro’s premium ogogoro, the Afrocentric liquor </h2>



<p>In commemoration of this year&#8217;s Africa&#8217;s Day, Facebook draws attention to a brand that is helping to reshape, refine and reproduce a drink viewed by many as a &#8216;drink for the streets&#8217;. This drink is popularly known as &#8216;ogogoro&#8217; and the brand that&#8217;s putting this drink on the global map is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pedrosafrica/?hl=en">Pedro&#8217;s Premium Ogogoro</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With an Instagram page that has been deliberately designed to charm people from all walks of life into getting a taste of this drink, Pedro is doing a great job of spreading the tentacles of Nigeria&#8217;s cultural drink into the world&#8217;s most urban regions. From Lagos Nigeria, Pedro’s premium ogogoro has now found a market in Ghana, Kenya and London. Let&#8217;s take a quick peek at seven things we can learn about this Afrocentric liquor that’s now finding its way to bars across the world.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ogogoro can be both traditional and modern</h2>



<p>A first glance at Pedro’s Instagram page portrays the enticing look of a bottle with a splendid blue label. Pedro’s has proven that the drink called ‘ogogoro’ can look premium and be compared with Western alcoholic drinks like vodka, whiskey, brandy, etc.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ogogoro is loved by all and sundry</h2>



<p>From the riverine communities of Nigeria’s southern regions, Pedro’s shows that ogogoro can transcend rural borders and find its way into the hands and homes of people living in highbrow areas of Lagos and other countries like Ghana, Kenya and the UK.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ogogoro isn’t just about the drink, it’s about the culture</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pedros16089062884273919410..jpg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-91487" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>Pedro’s Premium Ogogoro constantly shows how the culture behind the drink is vital. A preview of the photos on the brand’s Instagram page shows several images of African cultural items. It’s obvious that the culture is what drives the brand, not just the liquor. Maybe, there’s a spirit in this spirit drink called ogogoro.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pedros27043711455644987727..jpg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-91490" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">People love ogogoro</h2>



<p>Every now and then, you’ll see Instagram posts from Pedro’s explaining that their stock has been sold out which leads to a safe assumption that the demand for premium ogogoro is almost more than the supply.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">You can use ogogoro in cocktails </h2>



<p>Cocktails are known to contain such heavy spirits as whiskey and vodka but it’s interesting to note that ogogoro can also make for a good base in cocktail drinks and they can actually look and taste great.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ogogoro can also use some pairings</h2>



<p>Fans of alcoholic drinks are definitely aware of the multiple variations of meals and other stuff that probably go well with their favourite liquor. Ogogoro is not an exception. Asides distilling this premium spirit, Pedro&#8217;s goes through the task of educating the inexperienced or unknowing drinker about possible pairings that would be great with this drink.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pedros34606015975634821164..jpg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-91488" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Premium ogogoro is made from four key processes</h2>



<p>Premium ogogoro is obtained from the oil or raffia palm tree and has to go through four key processes namely, tapping, fermentation, distillation and refinement. The tapping is done in the rural areas by palm wine tappers; this is also where the natural fermentation occurs traditionally using wild yeast. The first round of distillation is also carried out by rural practitioners to help preserve the otherwise fermented sap. The final process is what separates premium ogogoro from its rural counterpart to give it that premium taste.</p>
