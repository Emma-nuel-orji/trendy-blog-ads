<p>The Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, has paid a condolence visit to the Al-Kadriyar family, whose six daughters were abducted on January 2.</p>



<p>During the visit to the family on Tuesday, Obi expressed concerns over the rate of kidnappings in the country and urged the government to curb insecurity.</p>



<p>Obi said, &#8220;I came to have the opportunity of condoling the family and then see the young ones that are still in the hospital.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is for all of us to sacrifice everything possible to see that criminality is contained.</p>



<p>&#8220;Can you imagine how it feels for a father to lose a young daughter. Imagine Folashade&#8217;s family as well. Just imagine the trauma. Imagine what they are going through.</p>



<p>&#8220;The government and the people must work hard to stop this. It is a very sad situation, I don&#8217;t even know how to start commenting, because this is happening everyday. We can&#8217;t continue this way.&#8221;</p>



<p>The PUNCH reports that about 19 abductees were taken away by bandits from the Sagwari Estate Layout in the Dutsen-Alhaji area in the Bwari Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory earlier in January.</p>

<p>They included six girls who were abducted from their home alongside their father, Alhaji Mansoor Al-Kadriyar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fb_img_17066381799318123730975578746076.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-144568" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fb_img_17066381799318123730975578746076.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fb_img_17066381799318123730975578746076.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>It was gathered that the gunmen later released their father, asking him to go get the ransom for the release of his daughters.</p>



<p>The kidnappers killed four of the hostages, including Nabeeha Al-Kadriyar, a 400-level student of Biological Science, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, and 13-year-old Folashade Ariyo.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fb_img_1706638184346467264671193754819.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-144566" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fb_img_1706638184346467264671193754819.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fb_img_1706638184346467264671193754819.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>The remaining five sisters regained their freedom on Saturday, January 20.</p>



<p>The PUNCH also reports that the Nigerian Police Force, on Sunday, disclosed that they arrested a suspected kidnapper, Bello Mohammed, 28, believed to be involved in the abduction and murder of Nabeeha.</p>

<p>The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, in the 2023 general election, Peter Obi, has responded to a recent comment made against him by Senate President Godswill Akpabio.</p>



<p>Akpabio had recently claimed that Peter Obi did not win the presidential election in Lagos and Ebonyi States, insisting the election was rigged in those places.</p>



<p>He said, “INEC must explain to us how you [Tinubu] would lose the election in Lagos during the presidential election. And Lagos was your base. In fact, one of the other explanations INEC will make to you is how you’ll win all the federal houses in Ebonyi States and we won the three Senate seats in Ebonyi State and they said you didn’t get 25 percent..”</p>



<p>Appearing on Parallel Fact, the former Anambra State Governor was asked to react to the comments of Akpabio about his election and Obi said he does not deal with uncommon people.</p>



<p>“The Senate President is an uncommon person, everything about him is uncommon. I don’t deal with uncommon people.</p>



<p>“I deal with common people…when uncommon people talk, common people keep quiet.</p>



<p>“I won the election not just in Lagos and Ebonyi, I won the elections in Nigeria. If not for Nigeria being an uncommon place we all know what happened,” Obi said.</p>

<p>The Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, on Monday, congratulated the Nigerian born professor, Ijeoma Uchegbu, who was appointed as the President of Wolfson College, at the University of Cambridge.</p>



<p>In a series of tweets on his X handle on Monday, Obi wrote, &#8220;I wish to joyfully congratulate Ijeoma Uchegbu, a Nigerian and Professor of Pharmaceutical Nanoscience, celebrated for her exceptional work in nanoparticle drug delivery, who has just been announced as the 7th President of Wolfson College, one of the 31 colleges of the University of Cambridge.</p>



<p>&#8220;Prof. Uchegbu, currently a lecturer at University College London, is also globally celebrated for her high intellectual and global works in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) which have won her numerous awards, fellowships, and accolades, as she continues to trail the blaze in pharmaceutical nanoscience.</p>



<p>&#8220;Her innovative breakthrough and academic excellence, reborn out of years of dedication and hard work, have not only led to the development of new treatments that promise to transform pain relief but have also paved the way for deeper research in pharmaceutical science for the improvement of health &#8211; a very critical index of human development. As she boldly steps into her new position next year, I wish her more all-around success.&#8221;</p>



<p>The former Anambra State Governor also stated that he is hopeful that she will make more global impacts, and through her position, raise a generation of enthusiastic researchers who will advance the frontiers of science, medicine and global health.</p>



<p>He also urged her to continue to contribute to the development of Nigeria, especially in health and education.</p>

<p>The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has initiated reconciliation efforts to bring back its former members, including Labour Party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi.</p>



<p>The PDP stalwarts said thoughts of a northerner vying for the party’s presidential ticket before 2031 should be abandoned. The announcement followed a meeting held at Chief Bode George’s office in Lagos on Monday, attended by party leaders, officers, and a group of national mobilisers led by Iteh Ubon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I thank the Organizers of the 52nd Annual Accountants (ICAN) Conference, and especially the 58th ICAN President, Mallam Tijani Musa for the kind invitation extended to me.</p>



<p>I join you today, not because I am an Accountant, but because we are all fellow believers in the search for a new Nigeria. Also, ICAN as a body of accountants continues to contribute to economic sustainability to the country.</p>



<p>Today, I will speak briefly on “Accounting As A Requisite For Sustainable Governance.” Whether you are involved in corporate, public, government or forensic accounting, all accountants are fundamentally concerned with financial records. Incompetence in financial records, totally distorts intended development. It is logical; therefore, that placing Nigeria on the part of economic prosperity will help reduce our national challenges to the barest minimum. We must therefore put in place, sustainable economic policies that will drive economic prosperity in the country</p>



<p>In keeping with our vision of moving the country from consumption to production, we must pursue sustainable economic policies that will help the nation to remain productive in all fronts and sectors For this reason we will endeavour to domesticate the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as part of our governance modalities.</p>



<p>We have a three-tracked plan aimed at achieving Goal 12 of the SDG, namely ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns.</p>



<p>Second, pursuant to Goal 9 of the SDGs our administration will from its inception continue to encourage investment in infrastructure, energy, transportation, irrigation and telecoms to grow these and other sectors.</p>



<p>We will expand the frontiers of financial inclusion to ensure that SMEs have greater access to credit to grow. We will work with financial institutions to improve their ability to identify credit worthy borrowers; and support inventory financing, which will help to unlock finance for SMEs dealing with high account receivables. All loans must be invested in regenerative projects. We shall pursue a drastic reduction in cost of governance and corruption; improve ease of doing business to attract Foreign Direct Investment to jumpstart industrialization and when borrowing is unavoidable, it will be strictly for production.</p>



<p>It is also imperative that henceforth, we should strive to operate within available resources and strive for a balanced national budget as cost saving measures.</p>



<p>I have touched on cost of governance and blocking leakages. The efficiency and credibility of any system whether an institution or even a government is closely linked to the credibility of its accounting system, and where there is disorganisation in the growth of any nation, you will always find discrepancies in the accounting practices.</p>



<p>Our message of probity, equity, innovation, competence, true brotherhood and visionary reconstruction in governance has not only been embraced by the youth, but has now become too many, their own personal and collective battle to take back our country, and rescue it from the difficult times with which we daily struggle.</p>



<p>As President, one of my priorities will be rule of law and due diligence, and promoting intangible assets, which are vital components of holistic security. This will also underpin public sector accountability.</p>



<p>We will abide by the Fiscal responsibility laws. All arms of government will be subject to routine audit this is the only way to ascertain the veracity of procurement figures, recurrent and concurrent expenses, even constituency projects.</p>



<p>Nigeria is not bereft of good governance ideas and plans. However, a combination of institutional weaknesses and lack of political will meant that various policies and strategies are poorly implemented leading to poor outcomes for the people.</p>



<p>My last points could easily have been my first, but I preferred not to lead with them. So let me touch on corruption. It is the issue of corruption and investment protection.</p>



<p>It is no secret that corruption has been endemic and one of the biggest obstacles to our economic progress in Nigeria. Corruption is the big elephant in the room. In the past few days we have seen videos of illegal pipelines connected to national oil pipeline networks, running for kilometers… where billions of dollars that should have been used for development and welfare, have been illegally siphoned away, for up to nine years, according to reports.</p>



<p>What I first expected was that the hierarchy of our top oil management bureaucracy will immediately resign, because without mincing words, this is irrefutable evidence of their incompetence, if not collaboration. My administration, when we come in, will tackle this corruption head on. We will have zero tolerance for corruption.</p>



<p>The truth is that the position of accountants in our society and in our public institutions is very vital in checking corruption especially in government.</p>



<p>But it is also true that the position of accountants in our society is also vital in aiding corruption in our society.</p>



<p>If you look at the written financial regulations in any establishment, you will see watertight regulations of auditing, vetting, tendering, vouchering, joint signatories and other safeguards, designed to check embezzlement and corruption, yet these sharp practices and misappropriated sums continue to rise, and I understand that there is now a Nigerian record of almost N109 billion allegedly embezzled by an accountant.</p>



<p>I know your profession is an honorable one, so I do not have to emphasise so much why it is important that you increase the level of peer surveillance and internal discipline among your ranks , if we cannot properly account for our finances, the country is finished, let us as accountants, do more to check and stop corruption.</p>



<p>May God bless the Accountancy profession and ICAN; the noble association of men of figures.</p>



<p>God bless our dear country, Nigeria.</p>

<p>Earlier, I received with sadness the reports of a boat mishap in Anambra State, which claimed no fewer than 76 lives and the destruction of 10,000 Hectares Of Olam Rice Farm and Mill in Nasarawa State valued at $20 million by floods.</p>



<p>These incidents, and very related unreported events have continued to occur in recent times. These are challenging times for us as a nation. But united in purpose and efforts, we shall come out stronger.</p>



<p>I mourn those who lost their lives in the boat mishap and those who died in different parts of the country, in the different natural disasters. I condole with their families. I encourage Olam Nigeria Limited to stay strong. We are all in this together.</p>

<p>Hours ago, the presidential candidate for Labour Party, Peter Obi was interviewed on Channels Television once again. During this interview, he spoke about Oil theft in Nigeria and how those in government want to keep him quiet by putting him in detention because he made it clear that they are the ones stealing oil in the country.</p>



<p>According to Obi, oil is not something an average Nigerian can steal easily and sell in Nigeria. He stated that to steal oil, a lot of protocols and processes are needed which involves the government.</p>



<p>He said, &#8220;For one to steal oil a ship has to come into your territorial water and load the oil. No ship ship can come in or leave after loading without the approval of the navy. This is where the government protocols come in.</p>



<p>&#8220;They want to find a way to put me in detention because I said it is those in government stealing oil. They always say Obi is causing trouble because they know those who are actually stealing the oil&#8221;.</p>
