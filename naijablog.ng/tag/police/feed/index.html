<p>POLICE DECRIES REPORT ON SALARY DEDUCTION, SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST FORMER IGP MD ABUBAKAR</p>



<ul><li>Slams Sahara Reporter for Deliberate Falsehood</li></ul>



<p>The NPF strongly condemns the spate of deliberate falsehood by the Sahara Reporters, particularly recent false publication against the incumbent Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Usman Alkali Baba, and another against a respected former IGP MD Abubakar. It is equally appalling that Sahara Reporters would ignore the ethics of professional journalism, and balanced reportage, and throw all caution to the wind in a bid to enjoy the thrills of sensationalism, albeit fleeting.</p>



<p>Emphatically, it is instructive to note that both referred false publications border on finances which are neither controlled actively by, or under the direct purview of the Nigeria Police Force. In the first instance, salaries of Police officers, as with other public servants, are paid on the IPPIS platform from the office of the Accountant General of the Federation. The Inspector-General of Police is equally paid, like every other officer, from the same platform. Access to make deductions, if any, rests with the handlers of the platform.</p>



<p>It is equally pertinent to note that the 20% increment approved by the Federal Executive Council affects only allowances and not basic pay which obviously explains the ignorance and mischief by Sahara Reporters, enforced by its failure to seek knowledge of the process before embarking on a wild goose chase.</p>



<p>Similarly, the Sahara Reporters goofed in its attempt to smear the reputation of the past Inspector-General of Police, IGP Mohammed Dahiru Abubakar (Rtd.) by alleging that he coerced officers to part with money which was mismanaged. This allegation is a falsehood by the news platform which intent is yet unclear.</p>



<p>To set the record straight, in 2013, the Nigeria Police Force acquired a mortgage institution, Fokas Savings and Loans Limited (now known as Nigeria Police Mortgage Bank Limited &#8211; NPMB), to assist every policeman to get housing loans from the Federal Mortgage Bank at low interest rates. As part of the prerequisites to re-capitalise the bank and effect its change of name as stipulated by law, the then IGP directed that the ownership of the bank be thrown open to all police personnel to buy into the shares of the bank.</p>



<p>Subsequently, sensitization activities were carried out and subscription forms distributed. Deductions for the shares were made from the account of the subscribers and accrued money remitted directly to the CBN. Shares certificates were thereafter issued and made available for pick up at the various branches of the NPMB and other designated police offices for the 151,238 Police subscribers. The NPMB in furtherance of its mission has, in the past 9 years, given out loans to the tune of 4.1bn Naira to police personnel in support of their house ownership aspirations.</p>



<p>The continued aggressive and false information being spread by the management of Sahara Reporters in Nigeria, most especially against the Nigeria Police Force, has become a source of concern as their reportage clearly stems from a position of purposeful disinformation which is highly unacceptable. The Force hereby calls on reputable media houses to entrench the importance of professional standards in reportage particularly where unverified information is concerned.</p>

<p>The Nigeria Police has knocked the action of a yet-to-be-identified policewoman, who was carrying the handbag of Titi, the wife of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar.</p>



<p>Mrs Abubakar on Wednesday unveiled a women-focused initiative in Abuja and her husband shared photos from the event, which showed her orderly standing with a handbag behind her.</p>



<p>When a tweep brought the attention of the police to the incident, the Force Spokesman, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, faulted the action of the policewoman and said appropriate sanctions would be meted out.</p>



<p>He said, “This is not acceptable. We have commenced necessary action on this. We will fish her out and get across to the principal. The AIG Special Protection Unit has been contacted to assist us get the woman police. Gradually, we will sanitise the system.”</p>



<p>Responding to another tweep, Adejobi added, “To us in the police, it’s an absurdity and should not be allowed to continue. To you, it might not be serious but to us, it&#8217;s serious for many reasons some of which are known to you as well. We don&#8217;t need any sentiment if at all we are serious about reform.</p>



<p>“My brother, this is bad for an orderly to carry bag for her madam, more so that the madam is not a service(sic) police officer. How does she defend her if there is any attack on her?”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Holds Colloquy with Police Mobile Force Leadership, Squadron Commanders on Election Security Management</h2>



<p>As part of the build up towards ensuring concrete security arrangements for the nation, particularly as the 2023 General Elections approach, the Inspector-General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, psc(+), NPM, fdc, has approved the training of the first batch of Bell 412EP B1.3 Type-Training Course for Police Airwing Aircraft Maintenance Engineers comprising seventeen (17) officers, whose training is expected to improve the technical expertise of the Aircraft Maintenance Unit of the Police Airwing and prevent operational mishaps during aerial surveillance operations.</p>



<p>Similarly, the IGP has approved the training of more Pilots on Cessna Citation, the training and maintenance of a fully operational Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) squad, training of more Engineers on both Fixed Wing and Rotary Wing, as well as training for other auxiliary aviation staff to streamline operational inadequacies, improve human resourcefulness and ensure enhanced operational efficiency and cohesive operations. The trainings, which were run simultaneously, in partnership with foreign experts, came to an end on Friday 30th September, 2022, with presentation of certificates of participation to the trainees by the Inspector-General of Police at the FHQ, Abuja.</p>



<p>In the same vein, the IGP has recently met with the leadership of the Police Mobile Force (PMF) and Squadron Commanders at the Force Headquarters, Abuja, where he appraised the internal security situation of the country and unraveled the possible ways of positioning the Nigeria Police Force for effective service delivery through strategic restructuring. The IGP noted that the PMF, under his leadership and command would be adequately restructured, equipped, with effective trainings, to align with its age-long tradition of basic unit concept and unit deployment.</p>



<p>The IGP reiterated the importance of proper election security management for the upcoming 2023 General Elections. He further challenged the Squadron Commanders to provide adequate security in their respective Areas of Responsibility, to support the conventional police not only during the general elections, but in ensuring and reassuring members of the public of their safety before, during, and after the elections.</p>



<p>The Inspector-General of Police further asserted that the present leadership of the Nigeria Police Force will continually embark on training and retraining of its officers to reposition the Police and invariably improve the general security of Nigeria even as the NPF attains its primacy in maintenance of law and order.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a Nigerian had a flat tyre on Iseyin-Ibadan highway. According to him, he flagged many motorists for help because his jack got spoiled in the process of trying to change the tyre but none of them stopped, understandably.</p>



<p>He has already resigned to fate until these good officers from Dugbe Police station came along. They didn&#8217;t only stopped, they went out of their way to replaced &amp; fixed the spare tyre.</p>



<p>When they were done, he begged them to take ₦3,000 as a token of appreciation but they rejected his plea. Their response was; &#8220;we didn&#8217;t stopped to assist you because of that, we are only doing our jobs&#8221;.</p>



<p>The three Officers are: Officer Tunmise, Officer Daudu and Officer Michael of Dugbe police station, Ibadan).</p>



<p>May God continue bless them.</p>



<p>God bless Nigeria Police.</p>

<p>A man identify as Elom Sunday Ali has taken to social media to called the attention of Deji Adeyanju for help as Police Officer along Ishieke Junction in Ebonyi State keep harassing motorist playing the road.</p>



<p>Elom Sunday Ali, said:</p>



<p>&#8220;Adeyanju Deji Please help us</p>



<p>This policeman and his cohorts have been harrassing motorists in a place called Ishieke junction in Ebonyi State. He is not the only police officer doing the dirty work but their is something different about him, the way he collects the money makes one feel as if he is entitled to it. We have agitated about it many times in the past but the state commissioner of police and the state government is yet to do something about it.</p>



<p>Sometimes they even extort money from students ridding their own bikes to school. Even if you are carrying weapons in your car, they don&#8217;t search your car, all they do is to collect money from you and you go unchallged with whatever you are carrying. We are begging the Inspector general of police to help us, they are really making life difficult for our people here in Ebonyi State, please help us.</p>



<p>Nigeria Police Force, I am writing this through my facebook page to draw your attention to what your officers are doing to our keke drivers, motorists and students of Ebonyi State University along Ishieke junction, Abakaliki/Enugu expressway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Police operatives attached to the IGP Special Task Force on Petroleum and Illegal Bunkering (IGP-STFPIB) in the late hours of August 7, 2022, successfully busted an illegal petroleum refining operation in Edo State. This follows the interception of intelligence on activities of an alleged illicit petroleum products refining syndicate operating adjacent to Agbor Junction, Benin City, Edo State via a whistle blower through the recently created Nigeria National Petroleum Company&#8217;s (NNPC) Command and Control Centre Portal.</p>



<p>Consequent to the raid on the illegal petroleum refining site, three (3) empty DAF Trucks, thirty-one (31) immobile surface tanks – 7 of which were loaded with unspecified quantity of petroleum products, were discovered by the Police. Additionally, two suspects, one Chinedu Iyanabor aged 18 and Sunday Iyagbesun aged 52, were arrested during the raid. Preliminary investigations reveal the site was also used as a dumpsite for petroleum products.</p>



<p>The Inspector-General of Police has tasked special enforcement units on prevention of activities of economic saboteurs to ensure deployment of necessary manpower and other operational assets to ensure a total clampdown on criminal activities detriment to the economic growth of the nation. The IGP has similarly supervised the strengthening of the Unit with a charge to intensify efforts, in conjunction with local police officers, to sustain police approved operational standards in tackling economic sabotage, crimes and criminality in the country. He equally charged the Assistant Commissioner of Police in charge of the Unit to embark on strict supervision of the Unit in compliance with the directives.</p>



<p>All suspects will be charged to court upon conclusion of investigations.</p>

<p>Man confronts police officers for asking him for hackney permit . He noted that he&#8217;s driving a private car and shouldn&#8217;t be asked for such . The Hackney permit is another document that is required to drive freely on Nigerian roads and particularly on Lagos roads without any form of harassment . To simply put it , the hackney permit is simply a license for vehicles below a certain weight category to carry goods within a state .</p>

<p>Nigeria Police has  Suspended Two Supernumerary Officers for Discreditable Conduct, Violation of Social Media Policy.</p>



<p>The suspension was contained in Press Statement signed by CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, Police Public Relations Officer, 26th of August 2022 in Abuja.</p>



<p>The suspended supernumerary officers  are identify as Obaze Blessing with SPY number 5709, and Obaze Emmanuella Uju with SPY number 5708.</p>



<p>Following the action, Inspector General of Police, issues Strick Warning for other defaulters.</p>



<p>The statement read in part:</p>



<p>The Inspector-General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, psc(+), NPM, fdc, has issued strict warning on the incessant, illegal and unwarranted use of Police Uniforms restricted to bonafide serving officers of the Nigeria Police Force. This is coming on the heels of the suspension of two Supernumerary Police Officers, with immediate effect, for breach of the provisions of the Police Act, 2020, and The Nigeria Police Guidelines for Recruitment/Promotion/Discipline of Supernumerary Police (SPY) 2013 by the Inspector-General of Police, as captured in a video posted by one of the officers in a viral video on August 3, 2022.</p>



<p>The Supernumerary Police, by the combined effects of the Police Act, 2020 and the Nigeria Police Guidelines for Recruitment/Promotion/Discipline of Supernumerary Police (SPY),2013 was established solely to complement the services of regular Police Officers when needed by Ministries, Departments and Agencies/Multi-National Companies, and Banks who make requests and upon approval pay for their training and cover their emoluments for the period of their engagement. (Sections 21-24 of the Police Act, 2020).</p>



<p>It is equally important to mention that in line with Section 25 (2) (3) of the Police Act, 2020 and the Nigeria Police Guidelines for Recruitment/Promotion/Discipline of Supernumerary Police (SPY), 2013issued by the Inspector-General of Police (Guidelines for SPYs), the mode of dressing of SPY police mandates its SPY officers above the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police not to wear uniforms. Similarly, extant laws delineate the Supernumerary uniform. It states that they must be on their approved uniform, ash coloured shirt with “SPY” inscriptions all over, over black with shoulder badge carrying the word “SUPERNUMERARY”. Supernumerary Officers adorning police black, neon blue or camouflage uniforms run afoul of the law and would be adequately sanctioned.</p>



<p>The suspended supernumerary officers – Obaze Blessing with SPY number 5709, and Obaze Emmanuella Uju with SPY number 5708, adorned themselves in conventional police officers’ uniforms contrary to the code regulating the SPY service. One of them similarly adorned the rank of Superintendent of Police which is contrary to extant laws. Above all, they portrayed themselves in the viral video and other videos as undisciplined and unprofessional, in contravention of the Police Social Media Policy, with acts glorifying ill-gotten wealth and ill-morals, which has received wide condemnation from members of the public.</p>



<p>The Police hereby calls on all supernumerary officers to adhere strictly with extant laws as strict sanctions would apply to erring officers. The Force is similarly revisiting other matters of infractions against members of the Supernumerary Police with a view to handing out necessary sanctions to other defaulters.</p>
