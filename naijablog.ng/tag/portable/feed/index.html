<p>Singer Portable’s alleged side chick, Elizabeth Adegoke, has accused him of abandoning her after impregnating her.</p>



<p>Speaking in a chat with Instablog9ja, she said: “He came for a show at a club in Egbeda on December 18, 2021. I was at the show with a friend when he saw me and asked someone to call me. We began dating afterwards and we were together until about three months ago when he literally abandoned me.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/instablog9ja_720p_20231216_032547.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Trouble started after I got pregnant and told him. He didn’t show concern or support me in any way. He told me to sponsor the pregnancy myself that I will enjoy after I birth the child.</p>



<p>When I learned about his third baby mama, Honey Berry’s pregnancy and how he was showing her love and affection, I decided to terminate mine at four months.</p>



<p>However, I had some complications, which has left me with severe pains ever since.</p>



<p>I recently went to the hospital to do a scan and they said my womb has issues. I decided not to tell him not to spoil his home but he stared ignoring me. He doesn’t even want to see me. I sent him messages but he didn’t reply any of them.</p>



<p>I’m even trying to chat him up just for him to help me but he turned me down. I see him helping different people but he don’t even care about me. Nigerians should please come to my aid, I am dying in pains.“</p>

<p>Street-pop artiste, Habeeb Okikiola, also known as Portable, has revealed that he was paid to endorse the All Progressive Congress presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu.</p>



<p>Portable had come under fire on social mediaPortable had come under fire on social media after declaring support for APC in the upcoming Osun State governorship election on his Instagram page.</p>



<p>In the video posted on Wednesday, he also asked Nigerians to vote for Tinubu in the 2023 presidential election.</p>



<p>Portable, however, fired back at his critics, saying he was only doing his job, as the ruling party had paid him to support its candidates.</p>



<p>“If they pay you money, you have to work. I was once paid to insult Tinubu during the protests. That was a long time ago. Now, APC has said Akoi Tinubu.</p>



<p>“If they pay you, do your job, no ripping. When I was asked to insult Tinubu, I collected my money and did my job. Now Tinubu is the next. They’re the ones that gave me money, and I must do the work for the money I collected. Akoi APC,” he said in Yoruba.</p>
