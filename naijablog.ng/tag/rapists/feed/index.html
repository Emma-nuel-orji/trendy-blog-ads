<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dr Olorunimbe Mamora, the Minister of State (Health), has suggested penile amputation as punishment for the rape offence in Nigeria.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Describing it as “total penile amputation”, Mamora said that the punishment is to place a check on the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>increase in the rate of rape in the country.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He attributed the increase during the lockdown to the reduction in socialisation. He also pointed out that solving a 10 year old rape case will be very difficult as it is no longer fresh.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He recommended total penile amputation as punishment for rapists because a woman might not be able to get over an incident of rape her entire life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mamora said,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I had argued this at a forum before and I said without any reservations that if for the consideration for global approach to de-emphasising capital punishment, then what to me should be the minimum is total penile amputation because a woman that has been raped may never get over it in her entire life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think that it would appear that the incident has increased within this period of COVID-19, which may just be a factor of people being kept at home because of the lockdown; socialising has greatly reduced and like it is said, an idle mind is the devil’s workshop.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People cannot vent their excitement as before, where people can go to clubs, bars and all that and be able to express themselves. Yes, there must be factors that must be responsible for this upsurge of rape at this point in time, but there should be no excuse.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>By Harrison Esien, From Uyo</p>



<p>*Awareness and assertive behavior may be your best defense against becoming an “easy target.”</p>



<p>*Hold your head up; walk confidently, directly and at a steady pace.</p>



<p>*If you feel you are in danger of being attacked, try to escape the situation by running away from it if you can.</p>



<p>*If you are being followed, head for a well lit area where you think there will be other people who may be able to help you.</p>



<p>*Stay alert and aware. Know where you are on campus and do not have access to a phone, locate the “emergency call box” on campus to contact University Police whenever you feel unsafe.<br />If you are in an emergency situation and have access to a telephone, contact University Police at 4911 or local law enforcement at 911.<br />Report any suspicious activity or persons on campus and/or off campus to the proper authorities immediately. Report any situation that is unsafe such as insufficient lighting, high bushes, broken locks and propped doors.</p>



<p>In Your Car</p>



<p>*Always make sure you lock your car doors, whether or not you are in the car. Always check the floor and rear seat before getting into your car.</p>



<p>*When returning to your car, make sure your keys are in your hand, ready for use in unlocking the door and turning on the ignition. They can also be used as a weapon, should that become necessary.</p>



<p>*If you suspect that you are being followed while driving, keep on going, do not stop and pullover until you get to some place that is well lit and where there are other people to assist you. If possible, drive to the nearest police station to let them know you are being followed.</p>



<p>*Avoid parking lots and garages that are poorly lit. Do not walk to and from your parked car alone if it is at night. Ask a group to walk together to the cars.</p>



<p>At Home</p>



<p>*Have good locks installed on all doors and be sure to use them. Make sure all windows are locked and well secured.</p>



<p>*Be sure you know whom you are opening your door to. If a sales or repair person is legitimate, they will not mind your asking to see identification and confirming their identity with the company they represent.</p>



<p>*Be cautious about revealing any personal information over the telephone and/or Internet.</p>



<p>*Draw your curtains or blinds shut at night so people on the outside cannot determine who is in the residence.</p>



<p>*Do not hide a spare key in obvious places such as under the mat, in a potted plant, in a fake rock or on the doorsill, etc.</p>



<p>Dating</p>



<p>*Know your sexual limits. What you want is critical, and you need to know what that is. Be assertive about your limits. You have the right to say “no.”</p>



<p>*Communicate your desires. Communication leads to stronger and more fulfilling relationships.</p>



<p>*Avoid being alone in isolated locations. If someone is leading you toward a secluded area, try to get away as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>*Rape can occur when one or both individuals are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Set limits on alcohol consumption.</p>



<ul><li>Scream! Scream!! Scream!!!</li></ul>



<p>Evil thrives in silence but escape can be earned when attention is drawn. If an attempt to be sexually-abused is made, be sure you don’t lose your voice. Shout until you can get attention. One of two things will likely happen – the culprit(s) would do everything to first ensure you’re cautioned from calling people’s attention that may be a bit unpredictably violent any way but it still saves or the culprit(s) gets forced to run away to avoid being apprehended.</p>



<p>*Apply caution in isolated places</p>



<p>As hard and unbelievable you may find this, nowhere is safe anymore, not even your homes. We live in a precarious world. If you must go to any isolated place, do NOT go alone. It’s somewhat better to go with at least a friend. Have police and any other people you trust on speed dial on your mobile phone. That also means your phone must be at a very close proximity. All of these will help if you are alert and stay conscious of your immediate environment though solitary. If you get any wind of someone or a group trying to invade your privacy in that location, opt for the options stated here.</p>



<ul><li>If you’re in a party, try this!</li></ul>



<p>It gets so lively in party and so extra folks (guys or ladies) may find you attractive that they can’t forget their senses. It’s not your fault that you’re gorgeous but help yourself to ensure that some frivolous persons don’t impress themselves on you. Take your drink or food even to the dance floor. Oh..!!! You get that, right? Desperate folks may want to poison your food or drink with some sleeping drugs and take advantage of your unconscious state. Also, ensure you are not drunk in a public place. If you are about to be, quickly excuse yourself before you’re noticed by anyone. You will become powerless when you’re tipsy.</p>



<ul><li>Extra measures call for extra actions</li></ul>



<p>When it gets violent, try harder! Trying harder may mean protecting yourself first. Can you grab something to wade off your offender(s), go for it? A rapist is capable of killing you, so your safety is paramount at that point. Find the fastest escape route and head straight to a police station. This is your first and legal action to take. Go to the police to report the situation with all on your as they are as the evidence, irrespective of how the attempt turns out, either one of the offenders gets injured or even dead.</p>



<p>Following these tips and strategies does not guarantee that a sexual assault will not occur. They are strategies to reduce the likelihood of becoming a victim.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The spokesperson of the Nigerian Police Force, Frank Mba has revealed the reasons why a lot of rapists get away with the crime in Nigeria.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He made this known in a chat on TVC. He said that the first reason why rape cases are never successfully prosecuted is because they are reported late. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He also disclosed that alteration of the crime scene largely affects the success of a rape investigation. He said,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8221;The fundamental problem for us as investigators are three. Number one is the fact that a lot of rape cases are reported very late and the fact that they are reported late, it impacts on the quality and the success of investigations. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The longer you stay in reporting a rape case, the higher the probability or the chances that evidence and the crime scene will be mismanaged.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although there is no status bar limiting the time you can report a rape case, you can even report twelve months later, but the earlier you report a rape case, the better and higher the chances of success.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frank Mba said that the most important part of a rape investigation is the management of the crime scene.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8221;As a matter of fact, in most crimes, how the crime scene is managed determines the success of investigations and people must remember that rape cases are even very special in the sense that in a rape case, there are two immediate crime scenes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first crime scene is place where the crime took place whether it is in a room, a car, a bush path or in a church like the case of Uwa. That particular place where the crime took place is a major crime scene.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The second crime scene is the body of the woman. Infact the body of the victim is a walking crime scene. It is a living crime scene. It is a mobile crime scene. And how we manage both the physical as well as that living crime scene will determine the success of an investigation.&#8221;</span></p>
