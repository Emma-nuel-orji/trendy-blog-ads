<p>If you ask anyone that has bought or hoping to buy land in Lagos about their obstacles in buying such land, they would tell you about the fear of an encounter with omo-onile. Some people have vowed never to buy in Lagos again because of the bitter experience with these people. No matter where you hope to buy land in Lagos, you are highly likely to have an encounter with them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who then are the omo-oniles?</h2>



<p>Omo-oniles are people who claim ownership of land. A land can belong to a family, someone sells it and gives you its papers. Then, other members of the family get wind of it and instead of fighting the seller, they decide to harass you. And if care is not taken, you may end up paying for and multiple times because they just keep showing up.</p>



<p>Omo-onile are not calm people you can take with leniency. They can be a big bone in your throat. You have to stand firm and serious if you don’t want your land property taken away from you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Buying land is not that simple -it involves a lot. This omo-onile may sell to multiple people, thereby causing serious trouble. And if you are not the type that likes while you may end up leaving that land out of frustration.</p>



<p>Alhaji Dauda, for the past 6 years is still having issues with them. Alhaji is a very tough man and the more they give him troubles, the more he is bent on not leaving the land. It even got to the point of going diabolical, yet, he didn’t budge.</p>



<p>One thing about other mo-online groups is that prevention is better than cure. Avoid them as much as you can and how you do this, I will highlight them in this article.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. You need a property Lawyer</h2>



<p>Not all Lawyers can handle this for you, that’s why you need a Lawyer who specializes in property Law. He/she will be able to handle it properly based on professionalism and experience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Go to the site with the land surveyor and your lawyer</h2>



<p>A land surveyor should:</p>



<p>-Read the coordinate of the plot with his GPS (Global Positioning System) and other instruments</p>



<p>-Compare the coordinate readings with the ones in the land survey if there is a copy already.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If it corresponds, then your lawyer/agent should go to Alausa with a copy to find out if the land is under Government acquisition or not. The response from Alausa will determine if you should move to the next stage or not.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Your Lawyer sees to proper paperwork</h2>



<p>These papers are important to be properly done:</p>



<p>-The land surveys</p>



<p>-Deeds of Assignment</p>



<p>-Land receipt</p>



<p>-Certificate of Occupancy&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>-Government consent should be prepared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When an omo-onile sees a Lawyer who knows her onion, they are hesitant to mess up, so they comply level-headed. Your Lawyer will organize a meeting between you and representatives of omo-one and all families involved in the said land transaction and make sure they append their signatures for proper documentation. You can go ahead with developing your land because after all these are achieved, it means that your property is safe.</p>



<p>4. Your Lawyer comes in again by negotiating a settlement with the omo-one of that neighborhood.</p>



<p>Each stage of development might involve the interference of omo-onile. That is why your Lawyer should meet them for negotiation before you start development at all just to avoid waste of materials because they could beat and harass your workers on site and that’s entirely a major issue.</p>



<p>&nbsp;If the news spreads, site workers may be unwilling to work on your site even if it’s all settled. Now, another issue is that if anyone is killed or maimed in the process of chaos, this issue might drain you for years because definitely, it will end up in court.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, you should also put into consideration the “Community Development Association.” You don’t want to keep having issues with these people because having so much trouble with them may end up extending your project to the stage of getting tempted to abandon it. so, it’s advisable that your Lawyer meets them ahead and discusses and negotiates a settlement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once this is done and the original receipt is given, you don’t have any problem going forward. Then your project will certainly move on smoothly without any interference/ disruption and will be completed within the stipulated time frame.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>That is Real Estate investment? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Real estate investment is the purchase, management, and sale or rental of real estate with the intent to make a profit whether immediate or in the long run. Real estate appreciates over time. Property bought four years ago has more value now if you intend to sell it and the more you leave it year in, year out, the more the value appreciates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Real estate is the new oil money as it brings fortune if done right and can be the beginning of generational wealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, you can easily make mistakes if care is not taken or you lack the right information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of the mistakes can be:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b> Not taking time to get adequate information</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not all property is good to invest in. The problem is not even with the property but oftentimes, with the location. If you buy a property as a means of investment in a place that has not much value because of circumstances surrounding it, you may find it difficult to sell or make your money from it. This is where adequate information comes in. You need to have much-needed information before investing in any property. Do your research and due diligence so it doesn’t end as a waste of money or property that yields little or no value.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><b> Meeting the wrong property vendor</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many people have fallen into this unawares till they are left with nothing. There are many fake vendors out there posing as real estate sellers. If you meet them, unfortunately, your money is gone. This is why property companies are highly recommended. At least, you know who you are dealing with has a structure.</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><b> Being ignorant of all documents involved in buying a property</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you want to buy a property as a first-timer, research all documents you are supposed to be given, or better still, employ the services of a property lawyer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You may end up losing a property to the dreaded omo-onile if you don’t have the complete or original documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of these mistakes are mostly made by investors buying a property for the first time but you can avoid them only if you are properly informed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let’s look at the pros and cons of property investment</span></p>
<p><b>PROS</b></p>
<p><b>i.Steady cash inflow</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Investing in rental property is one of the most beneficial investments you can ever make because of how it keeps yielding a return on investment all year round. Some landlords do prefer monthly payments. Imagine having 3 or more tenants paying into your account every month, that should make anyone happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, this applies to an investor leasing out a property.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b> Long-term Security</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If your property is on government-approved land, then, there is nothing to worry about. Your investment is permanent and will continue to yield profit forever. You can rest assured of financial security for a very long time.</span></p>
<p><b>iii. The value keeps appreciating</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When you invest in a property like land, it keeps appreciating yearly. Take, for instance, Ibeju-Lekki. Ibeju-Lekki was not a hot cake a few years ago but then, look at it now, Ibeju-Lekki is one of the most sought-after places in Lagos when it comes to buying properties (whether land or structure).</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b> You can decide to keep it for as long as you want</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For people who would like to keep something worthwhile down for their children, this is best for you. Investing in property for keeps is a great option with a great financial benefit. Imagine buying land for 500,000 when your child is still 2 years old only to hand it over when he/she turns 25. Calculate how big it would have appreciated in a space of 23years.</span></p>
<p><b>v.It doesn’t have to move with you</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike other valuable property which you may need to sell off or gift out if you are relocating abroad, land and structure-property do not have to be disposed of in that form. You could decide to make it yield in absentia. For instance, rent out the structure or lease out land to farmers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">CONS</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b> High maintenance</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyone involved in property investment should know that it cost so much to maintain unless you don’t mind having a property looking awful, of course, this would affect the value being placed on it. For example, rental property.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b> It involves a large capital </b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Property investment is no joke. You could empty your account just to invest in property and this doesn’t mean you would get the returns in multiples almost immediately. For land to give you a much-needed return, it has to wait a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a rental property to yield the money invested + profits, it would take some years as well. So, when you heavily invest, you also need to consider that patience is a virtue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suffice to say, property investment is worth every bit of it. It’s an investment you can rely on come rain, come sunshine. If you have not considered it before, I guess it’s time you start thinking about it. And not just think, take a profitable step!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Buying a rental property is a good step in the real estate business. However, I would advise that you shouldn’t barge into it without having some knowledge of what you are getting into. Despite having many people successfully running a rental property, still, it’s not easy money. There are obstacles, losses, risks, etc. but if you can figure it all out, then, you find it a successful investment.</p>



<p>Now, what do you need to know?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. The property has to fit into what the people around want</h2>



<p>This is very crucial. If you are buying a property close to the campus, be rest assured that 95% of potential tenants will be students. If you intend to make it a family home, then, you may find it difficult to get renters who are not students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If people around are working class with good jobs, this will increase your property value because renters will be ready to buy at a premium price.</p>



<p>You need to put people whose population is higher into consideration before buying a property for rent. If it works, you can go ahead.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Location is as important as the air we breathe</h2>



<p>If you want to get a good return on your investment, you need to be keen on location. Location can strengthen your investment, and at the same time kill it. It determines what value to be placed on it. If you buy a rental property, renovate and furnish it in underdeveloped areas, you may be disappointed in hearing the value people place on it. Also, if your rental property is in a place that is not all that motorable due to bad roads, or the roads always get flooded during heavy rainfall, this may be a huge obstacle to getting renters that would be willing to pay something worthwhile. And what is a business if you are not getting anything from it?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Check out the taste of structures within the locality</h2>



<p>This should be highly considered because it’s a great determinant of having people interested in your property. Can you afford to have the property renovated up to taste? The property you are buying is not a new model, it is best to check out for structures around so you can make an adaptation or do something better. This helps you get renters easily and also willing to pay its value.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Renting property is dicey</h2>



<p>The truth is you can’t be good enough, smart enough, and do everything right. Just a little mistake might make you lose the property. The fault may be or may not even be from the tenants or anyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Major damage such as fire outbreaks can ruin your investment. An economic downturn caused by anything, for example, a pandemic may make you lose money because if your tenants are unable to pay or move out without anyone showing interest in occupying, it’s a big loss on your part.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. You are responsible for maintenance</h2>



<p>As much as landlords try to avoid this part but at the end of the day, it falls back to you as the owner of the property. This is where you are reminded that it is your house and the responsibility to keep it together lies with you. This is a major reason some landlords take maintenance fees from tenants in case there is damage. However, this fee can just cover a little of the damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The major repairs still lie with the landlord whether he is willing to or not.</p>



<p>Apart from having damages, maintaining a house is the only means to keep a property whole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things have to be checked, adjustments have to be made and repairs have to be done.</p>



<p>All of these rest on the shoulders of the property owner.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Get everything documented</h2>



<p>Everything about your property has to be documented. One of such is “agreement.” In Nigeria, many people take things for granted which may turn out to be a bigger issue sooner or later. Some houses have no landlord-tenant agreement for whatever reason. This shouldn’t happen in normal circumstances. When push comes to shove, that agreement which seems like a piece of paper to many might be the only evidence to bail you out.</p>



<p>And all documents concerning tenant evaluation and rent must be considered too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-73475d3b-7fff-1e81-57b7-650fcce3f975" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">There is so much excitement that comes with leaving a country like Nigeria. Some of the reasons for this are that people feel, at last, they are free from the hardship, insecurity, etc. that have eaten deep into the country.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s common for people to want to sell their properties for various reasons. Some do it as a means to get more money to travel with, while some do so because they feel they no longer need the property since they don’t intend to come back to Nigeria anymore.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">When Mr. Phillip and his family wanted to relocate, there were two houses available that they owned. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">He was bent on selling them but his wife advised against it. She thought that since her husband has a trusted person who could be in charge, they should rather rent them out and still get their return on investment in absentia. Mr. Phillip didn’t agree. He just didn’t care about the country or anything it has to offer anymore.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;"> This is understandable. A lot of people would prefer to do away with anything that could give them stress once they step out of Nigeria. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">So, he sold them and they all traveled out. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">The first few months were quite rocky for them because Mr. Phillip couldn’t get a job on time which was not envisaged. The bills were on his wife and she got choked at some point. Then, he thought about the houses he sold. If he had maintained and rented at least one of them, something, even if not much would come in for him.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">Like I said earlier, when people decide to leave every form of baggage in Nigeria, we can’t blame them. However, we need to see beyond the immediate excitement and have a better understanding of how our steps can either be advantageous to us or not. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">So, what should you do instead of selling off your properties? </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">If you are not selling because you desperately need money, then you should read this…</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;">
<h1>1. Rent that property out</h1>
<h1></h1>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">This should be given consideration. There are many house owners abroad, so this isn’t a bad idea. I would advise that you make rent payments monthly. Asides from that it’s favorable to you because your account will be permanently credited by tenants monthly, it also helps your tenants as well. Monthly payment is a relief to most people because they can easily take it out from their salaries if they are salary earners than paying all at once by the time their rent expires. So, it’s a win-win. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">You may not be in Nigeria, but your property still fetches you money and that’s the most important thing.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;">
<h1>2. Lease it out</h1>
<h1></h1>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">For people who would like to use the property for various reasons such as making it a school, church, offices, etc., you will be doing yourself a favor by leasing it out to them. Of course, it’s a contract with an agreement. You could make it a few years and this makes you rest assured that you have an income from Nigeria and apart from this if you decide to come back to Nigeria, you will find the property intact. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;">
<h2>3. Convert the property</h2>
<h2></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">I don’t think there&#8217;s anything wrong with having a business here and living abroad. A lot of people might feel discouraged but it’s worth giving it a try. You could convert the property to a mini-mall, bookshop, or studio. Since you won’t be there, this is what you should do: liaise with someone who needs space and has the required skill and experience to run the business. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">Equip or store up the place, then have an agreement of a percentage you should be expecting. To people in Nigeria, the person is the owner, meanwhile, he is just standing in for you in the form of a partnership.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">This is what we call sleeping while your money works for you.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;">
<h2>4. Make it a home for tourists</h2>
<h2></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">Just like a short-let apartment, you can make it a place of rest for tourists. However, this works if there are tourist sights in that city. Also, this is making your property in the form of a mini-hotel. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">Although, you can’t do this without having some things in place before traveling. And if the expenses will be overwhelming for you, find an investor who might be interested in that business.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;">
<h2>5. Make it an event center</h2>
<h2></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">This largely depends on the size of the property. But for simple events such as seminars, workshops, low-key weddings, etc., your property can fit in. it’s just that you need a representative and staff to help you run it in your absence.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.3800000000000001; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#000000; background-color:transparent; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">In conclusion, your property can still make money for you. Don’t be in a hurry to sell it off. I know a bigger challenge might be finding a trustworthy fellow to stand in with all honesty. However, I believe you know a lot of people and out of them, there should be at least one good person to do the job.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.7999999999999998; background-color:#ffffff; margin-top:0.0pt; margin-bottom:0.0pt; padding:19.0pt0.0pt19.0pt0.0pt;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Arial; color:#212529; background-color:transparent; font-weight:700; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; text-decoration:none; vertical-align:baseline; white-space:pre; white-space:pre-wrap;">Dennis Isong helps individuals invest right in Real estate.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It has been a little bit hard after the pandemic and Nigeria hasn’t found its feet yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s even a lot more complicated with the constant rise in dollar and inflation which don’t seem to have any feasible solution yet.</p>



<p>But despite all these, the Real Estate sector in Lagos has strongly stood the test of time. Of course, we have testimonies of people investing and cashing out big from this sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lagos is currently the most populous city in Africa and alone is ranked the 5th largest economy in Africa.</p>



<p>Properties in Lagos can yield double the return on investment only if you are ready to play the long-term investment game and know how it works and what you are doing.</p>



<p>There are enough opportunities in Lagos for anyone who wants to make money in Real Estate in Lagos.</p>



<p>Someone like Barrister Teslim got lucky by working for a billionaire some years back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of spending all the money carelessly and philandering, he diverted it to land investment in Lagos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He was part of the first set of people that saw a bigger prospect in Ibeju-Lekki and bought as many acres as he could afford many years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do you know how valuable land property is in Ibeju-Lekki? Now imagine someone who had bought land in the location years ago!</p>



<p>You may be confused about how to make money from Real Estate in Lagos but that will be discussed in this article.</p>



<p>1. Land flipping</p>



<p>Ibeju-Lekki is one of the outskirt areas being developed on Lagos Island and it has been like that for some time now which suggests that there’s no stopping soon. These features are currently going on:</p>



<p>-4th Mainland bridge planned to link this region</p>



<p>-An airport</p>



<p>-Golf course</p>



<p>-The Dangote Refinery&nbsp;</p>



<p>And much more development is planned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these should be enough reason for getting land in this region because it’s a great investment as the prices are still minimal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What should a good investor do?</p>



<p>-A good investor can analyze upcoming regions and purchase land in bulk just like Barrister Teslim.&nbsp;</p>



<p>-After purchase, then wait for a few years when the value has appreciated due to development in the area.</p>



<p>-Lastly, resell to estate developers or homeowners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A good land flip can return more than 500% ROI in a space of a few years if properly planned and executed.</p>



<p>2. You could focus on Offsite Property Development</p>



<p>Developers and investors are making huge profits from this aspect of Real Estate in Lagos presently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How does this happen? What are the steps to take?</p>



<p>i.The developers spot a sizable amount of land</p>



<p>ii. He projects how to increase the value by building a gated estate or block of flats for direct sale to homeowners.</p>



<p>iii. Once the plan is good, the investor makes the initial investment for purchase and sets up the land for building.&nbsp;</p>



<p>iv. Then the marketing team of the real estate company or developer swings into action. One of the ways to make it an easy run is to allow for payment by installment plan from the end homeowners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these are done even when the property is still being developed. And at the end of the day, the investor and developer (Real Estate Company) make a sizable profit, which they can use to repeat the cycle a second time and so it continues that way.</p>



<p>3. Real Estate Investment Management</p>



<p>Apart from the saying that “money is made through money”, isn’t it obvious from our day-to-day activities? Normally, real estate deals with high-profit returns which require huge investments for anyone. Is there hope for an average investor? An average investor,/can join, set up, or manage a Real estate investment Management Fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. Becoming a landlord to invest in long-term rentals</p>



<p>The shelter is important, so people would either need a place to stay or to do business (shops and offices). So, what do you come up with that fits into people’s demands?</p>



<p>&nbsp;You buy or build a residential rental. This can be in blocks of apartments or even shared spaces(office) is a good way to get started.</p>



<p>However, this can be more favorable if you are in the right location. When it comes to Real Estate, location matters most.</p>



<p>This is a sure way of reaping profits for as long as possible.</p>



<p>5. Home-Renovation Flipping</p>



<p>People are yet to pay attention to this. However, you can have a double return on investment if it’s done right. You buy or even rent an old house in a very prime location, renovate and refit it. Then put it up for sales or rent. For example, you can rent or buy a beat-up 5-bedroom duplex, refit it into separate rooms, self-con, or studio apartments, then re-rent it out and recoup your initial investment with some profit to spare.</p>



<p>6. Contract Flipping</p>



<p>This is purposely done for distress sales. A lot of people sell their properties as distress sales. It’s important to find these people early, buy the property, add value to it or just put it at a higher sales price and wait for a buyer who will buy it from you at a more profitable deal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>7. Shortlist and Vacation Rentals</p>



<p>The shortlist business in Lagos is booming silently. The easy thing about having a short-let apartment is that you can start with a low-cash investment. For example, you can make double the profit if you invest 8 million naira at the end of the year. Although, this business is not easy neither is it for the faint-hearted because it’s not easy to manage as it requires some experience and access to pivotal information. Nonetheless, if you are on track,&nbsp; your investment is sure to return big for you.</p>

<p>Buying a property is not as much as knowing where to buy the property. You can buy a property and end up discovering that the chosen area is a big mistake because of the lack of its profitability. There are certain features you should look out for when buying a property and one of them is its proximity to general amenities such as a popular hotel, shopping mall, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But we are focusing on a shopping mall in this article.</h2>



<p>Buying an apartment is always the first choice for people who are interested in getting started with a real estate investment. But with most investments, you have to start it right. An obvious choice for your real estate investment would be an apartment in a highly-urbanized area, specifically properties that are near shopping malls.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Easy access to products and items that are only available in shopping centers</h2>



<p>If you ask many people, they would tell you how tedious it is looking for household/personal needs to buy and not finding them close by. It’s frustrating to go to your nearby store and then realize that they are all out of your favorite household brand. This is why it’s a big advantage to live in an apartment that is near a shopping center. You won’t have to worry about looking for a certain product or item because you know that the store has a lot of them in stock. Also, going from your apartment to the shopping center is just a few meters away, making the whole experience faster and more comfortable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Access to schools, parks, and other recreational facilities</h2>



<p>An area that has a mall facility is an area that bustles with activities. Such areas will have schools, parks, hospitals, etc around which makes having a property close by worthwhile.</p>



<p>Besides, these places are very convenient for a person with a growing family.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. A shopping center makes for a great landmark</h2>



<p>Landmarks are important features to look out for when buying a property. One of the biggest issues with moving to a new place is having to describe your new place. However, if you’re living right next to a shopping center or commercial district, you can easily tell your friends or family members to find the particular shopping center and call them out once they’ve arrived.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4.No problem with public transportation</h2>



<p>Unlike some places where getting transportation is an extreme sport because of where it’s located, property near a shopping mall does not have issues with that. Since it’s an area bustling with activities, you are sure of a good and active transport system.</p>



<p>It is very easy to pick up and sends off your visitors should they want to visit you in your apartment. The same can also be said for you when you need to commute either for work or travel.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Availability of many shops and restaurants near the shopping center</h2>



<p>You are open to choices and varieties because of the availability of shops and restaurants.</p>



<p>A shopping center is bound to have a lot of small shops and restaurants that you and your family can enjoy. Besides, who doesn’t want to eat out in a fancy restaurant just a few meters away from your doorstep?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Your apartment is located right in the heart of the city or town</h2>



<p>Mall developers make sure that their business is always located in an area where a lot of people pass by and/or meet during the day. So, if your apartment is located right next to a huge shopping center, then you can be sure that your apartment is located right in the heart of the city. You are in the vicinity of the most vital parts of the city such as the main road, schools, and business districts.</p>

<p><strong><em>By Dennis Isong</em></strong></p>



<p>Two years ago in Oyo town, Owode, to be precise, a room in one of the old houses was rented out to a man. After a few months of familiarizing himself with people around, he asked the Landlord to allow him to display a few of his things in front of the house (he sold household gadgets) and he was allowed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After another 6 months, he told the landlord that he was traveling and since there’s no issue with that, the landlord didn’t read any meaning to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One week after, a woman (Mrs. B) came to the house to ask for him, and the landlord reported that he had traveled. The man that followed her asked the landlord a few questions, unfortunately, he couldn’t answer. So, he was arrested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The man that followed Mrs. B was a police officer and no one knew because he wasn’t wearing a uniform which was on purpose.</p>



<p>When they got to the station, it was made clear to the landlord that he had accommodated a wanted 419 and he had to produce him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The landlord explained to them that he ran a business and he hadn’t moved out. And then, they went to check his room. On getting there, they saw that he had cleared all the things in the room unknown to the landlord.</p>



<p>This case went on for weeks before the landlord was eventually bailed. Many people in jail now are not supposed to be in jail but it happened for the little mistakes that seemed irrelevant initially.</p>



<p>Tenants can leave your house within a twinkle of an eye and you may not know the havoc they must have caused until it becomes a police case.</p>



<p>What are the mistakes landlords make?</p>



<p>1. Not having any traceable information about the occupants&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many landlords, especially those that are not living in Nigeria or close to where they have their property are guilty of this. When you leave your property in the hands of agents, do you also monitor the kind of people moving into the house? It is your property and there should be a level of zealousness just to avoid cases like the one that happened in Oyo. There are too many criminals out there frantically looking for accommodation to perpetrate evil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When people come to you, do your background research. I know of a landlord that calls potential tenants&#8217; place of work just to confirm that they truly have a legitimate job. Little research is paramount, don’t take it for granted.</p>



<p>2. Accepting occupants based on emotions</p>



<p>People do this. We hear a sob story and lose our guard. Bad people take advantage of this. All stories you are being told must be verified. You are not a bad person trying to protect your property because if push comes to shove, you (the landlord) will bear the larger burden of the problem.</p>



<p>You should do away with emotions so you can make a sound judgment.</p>



<p>3. Not having rules binding tenants to the house</p>



<p>This is very important. don’t treat your property nonchalantly. Set rules for occupants and make sure you also follow the rules. Not having rules is a mistake you should not make as a landlord because you are just setting yourself up for a big problem.</p>



<p>One of the things that should bind you, the tenants, and the house rules. Without rules, it will collapse, literally. Rules binding tenants will curb excesses. There might be issues but it won&#8217;t be as horrible as not having any rules.</p>



<p>4. Handing over the affairs of the house to a tenant also living in the same house</p>



<p>Landlords make this huge mistake. I am sure you might be wondering why and who should have been in the best position for it. I will tell you why. Do you think a tenant being put in charge of others will be neutral? Do you think he/she will be totally sincere with you? Do you think he/she doesn’t have a close friend and an enemy in the house and makes things favorable to one while the other is at the receiving end because of personal issues?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this situation, where the “house captain&#8221; also lives with the subordinates, it brings chaos and disarray eventually.</p>



<p>The best fit for the job is an outsider who will be neutral and not emotionally attached to anyone.</p>



<p>5. Gossiping about tenants to one another</p>



<p>Please don’t do this. If you have an issue with any tenants, approach/her on a personal level. Gossiping about tenants to one another gives room for disrespect and I am sure it’s not something you want to deal with.</p>



<p>In some communities, if a tenant is going beyond his boundaries, he is allowed to make a report to the landlord’s association and such cases will be treated accordingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;EXCISION IN PROCESS&#8221; or “EXCISION IN PROGRESS”is the most commonly utilized land scam gimmick use as of recent by some of the real estate companies, agents, and land marketers, particularly in Ibeju Lekki. These real estate agents use it to entice purchasers to buy their lands, they say that they are undergoing &#8220;Excision Processing&#8221; and that the property already has a &#8220;FILE NUMBER.&#8221; It&#8217;s still a swindle, whether they say it innocently or carelessly, and investors should be wary of this act.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, if a property&#8217;s title at the time of acquisition is &#8220;EXCISION IN PROCESS&#8221; and &#8220;FILE NUMBER,&#8221; is stated, it still doesn’t make the Landed property a good title for one to purchase. It simply implies nothing and the property can be acquired back by the government without any compensation. To better comprehend what an &#8220;Excision in Process&#8221; is, I&#8217;ll try to explain what it means and how it&#8217;s become the most fraudulently used word in Nigeria today to put millions of people at risk with their investment. In this article, I’ll be explaining the dangers involved in acquiring such a property with the supposed title &#8220;EXCISION IN PROCESS&#8221; or “EXCISION IN PROGRESS”. But before then, let’s find out the meaning of this title &#8220;EXCISION IN PROCESS&#8221;.</p>



<p>Definition of Excision in Progress</p>



<p>It&#8217;s impossible to understand the term &#8216;excision&#8217; without referring to this well-known property law.According to the Land Use Act of 1979, it states “The Land Use Act of 1979 stipulates that every portion of land belongs to the government.”This is when the term &#8220;excision&#8221; comes into play.</p>



<p>Excision implies taking a section of a whole and recording and documenting that portion of land in the official government gazette of that state, making it legally exempt from government acquisition.</p>



<p>What is Exactly is the meaning of the Land title “Excision in Progress”?</p>



<p>It is necessary to excise land before it can be returned to indigenous communities.As a result, excision in progress or excision in process refers to the process of returning land taken by the government to indigenous owners or communities.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in this article, we want to discuss the risks involved in Purchasing property with the Land title “Excision in Progress” since we now understand both the meaning of Excision and Excision in Progress.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Not A Title: This is the most important aspect of this article. There’s nothing like “Excision in Progress or Excision in Process”as a Land title. A land title can’t be an excision in progress.Here in Nigeria, we only have the following Land titles such as;</li></ol>



<ul><li>Excision &amp; Gazette which simply means the government releasing a portion of land that had previously been subject to global acquisition to the community or individual for development. They’ll be issued a government-approved excision, and documentation for the land can be completed up to the level of the governor&#8217;s assent.</li></ul>



<p>Meanwhile, the gazette is an official record book that contains all of the data about a plot of land that has been excised and returned to the community. The information includes the name of the community as well as specifics on the area of land that has been carved out. The land is normally gazetted when the excision document is delivered to the surveyor general&#8217;s office. A person can apply for a certificate of occupancy or governor consent through a gazette.</p>



<ul><li>Certificate of Occupancy known as C of O is an authorized document of grant issued by the State Government to an individual, a group of investors to confer ownership and right of occupancy in a specific piece of land for all uses for a period of time not to exceed 99 years, subject to renewal.&nbsp;</li><li>Governor’s consent simply refers to the approval of any land transaction by the governor of each state in Nigeria. Consent is normally essential for the completion of any land transaction, therefore it&#8217;s an important component of the process. The main goal of obtaining a Governor&#8217;s Consent is to notify the government that land ownership has been transferred to someone else.</li></ul>



<p>Therefore, you should be aware that &#8220;excision in progress&#8221; or &#8220;excision in process&#8221; is not a legal land title for any property and not recommended.</p>



<ol start="2"><li>No Structure is Allowed:Construction of any structure either a residential or commercial area is not permitted on &#8216;Excision in Progress&#8217; land.As you may be aware, the government owns the land that has been acquired.And as such, building or erecting a structure on it is not allowed, as such building can be pulled down by the government at any given time, if the government decides to take the land tomorrow and it’ll occur without any compensation.</li><li>No Red Copy Survey:For &#8216;Excision in Progress&#8217; Land, the government does not provide a red copy survey. Even though, we’ve seen some companies across Nigeria online platform advertising for properties and claiming that they are awaiting approval, and that the land has a Red Copy Survey.The truth is that a land that is pending excision from the surveyor general&#8217;s office cannot be awarded a red copy survey since the land does not have a legal land title.</li><li>Not 100% Sure:Excision Approval is 50-50 Chance and may not be approved. Regardless of whether or not the land is committed, the government may or may not agree to the excision application. Therefore, it’s safer not to acquire any Land with the “Excision in Progress” title because there’s no title like that and wait until the land is fully Excised.</li></ol>
