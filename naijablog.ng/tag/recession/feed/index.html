<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is official that the UK has gone into recession for the first time in 11 years and this can be attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the Office for National Statistics, the UK gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have fallen by a record 20.4% in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020, marking the second consecutive quarterly decline after GDP fell by 2.2% in the previous quarter (Jan to Mar) 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This recession&#8217;s been described as two straight quarters of economic decline since 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The deputy national statistician for economic statistics, Jonathan Athow said that the economy bounced back in June after the monthly gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 8.7% following growth of 2.4% in May 2020, but it wasn&#8217;t enough to recover the lost output earlier in the year. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The economy began to bounce back in June with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and housebuilding continuing to recover.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite this, gross domestic product (GDP) in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.&#8221;</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">The ONS said that the decline in output was driven by the shutdown of shops, hotels, restaurants, schools, and car repair shops.</span></li>
