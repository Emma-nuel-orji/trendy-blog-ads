<p>Reno Omokri words read:</p>



<p>Some things that happen In Catholicism and Anglicanism can never happen in the genuine following of Yeshua or in Islam. A faithful follower of Yeshua has more in common with a genuine Muslim than with a Catholic or Anglican. That is why when Catholic Europe expelled Jews on March 31, 1492, the Muslim Ottomans and the Islamic Moors granted them automatic asylum.</p>



<p>Since you were born, how many times has Islam been updated? If you are honest, you will agree that the answer is NEVER.</p>



<p>Only man-made religions need updating. The Word of God is settled. It never changes.</p>



<p>Your holy book says women have no place in ministry (1 Timothy 2:12, 1 Corinthians 14:34). Your holy men say they do. And you jettison your holy book and follow the word of your holy men.</p>



<p>Your Scripture says marriage is exclusively between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:24). Your Pope and Archbishop say priests can bless a union between two men. And you obey men rather than God?</p>



<p>When faced with this same predicament in Joshua 24:15, Joshua said, &#8220;Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve&#8221;. He then concluded, &#8220;But as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.”</p>



<p>Tomorrow, you will carry your leg that God created and still go to that church to allow such men to continue to lead you away from what your God told you.</p>



<p>And when your attention is drawn to it, you say, &#8216;Judge not&#8217;. That is how you will be like the frog that continued to adjust to ever-increasing water temperature until the water became too hot for it to jump and escape.</p>



<p>In Numbers 23:8, Balaam said, &#8220;How can I curse those whom God has not cursed?&#8221;</p>



<p>And in the year 2023, the Catholic Pope is asking priests to do tye reverse. To bless same-sex marriages that God has not blessed. Is that not a contradiction of what Scripture tells us in Numbers 23:8?</p>



<p>As a Catholic, choose who you will follow. The word of God or the proclamation of Pope Francis! Because you cannot simultaneously follow both.</p>

<p>Reno Omokri words read:</p>



<p>In this photo you see Bishop Oyedepo kneeling before Pastor Adeboye for prayers. In the Catholic Church, Cardinals do the same thing with the Pope. If we are to be honest, there is godfatherism in religion, politics, and business. You hear different pastors calling either Pastors Adeboye, Oyedepo, Oyakhilome, and so on, their spiritual fathers. What is that? You witness various entrepreneurs calling great men like Dangote, Adenuga, Otedola, and Elumelu their mentors. What do you call that?</p>

<p>Without Generals Babangida and Abdulsalami Abubakar, General Obasanjo would not have transformed into President Obasanjo in 1999. They packaged him! Without Obasanjo, Yar&#8217;adua could not have defeated Babangida and Buhari. Never. Without Obasanjo again, President Jonathan would not have defeated Buhari in 2011. And without Tinubu, Buhari would have been a washed-up has been.</p>



<p>How many of you who went to boarding schools could have survived and thrived without a school father or mother?</p>



<p>Whether you call it spiritual father, mentor, or Jagaban, godfatherism is a way of life on Earth. A mentor, like Pastor Enoch Adeboye, shortens the distance between you and success. But when you try to shorten the distance between you and your mentor, the mentor can metamorphose into a tormentor, the way the Bishop of Enugu did to Reverend Mbaka!</p>



<p>Even that statement that pastors like to use, &#8216;God does not call the qualified, He qualifies the called&#8217;, if you analyse it, what does it mean? David, the last born of Jesse, became king of Israel over his seven older brothers. Favour and grace are just another name for godfather!</p>



<p>It is just that too large a critical mass of the sub-Saharan Black Africans are emotive rather than strategic. And insult and aggressiveness are just a way of life of particular ethnicities amongst our people. But when managed properly, it can be a good model for success. Otherwise, this is a fact of life.</p>

<p>His words read:</p>



<p>One thing that people have tried to use to discredit the inerrancy of Scripture is the fact that Cain was able to marry and have children, even though there is no record of Adam and Eve having daughters at the time when he killed his brother, Abel. They see this as evidence that there were either other people on Earth at that time, unlike what Scripture says, or that Scripture is inaccurate and reliable.</p>



<p>Neither position is accurate. Let me explain.</p>



<p>1 Corinthians 2:14 says:</p>



<p>“But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.”</p>



<p>If your natural senses lead you, you can never understand the Word of God. The Word is spiritual. Christ said as much in John 6:63:</p>



<p>“It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life.”</p>



<p>So, how did Cain have children and propagate his lineage after he was banished from the presence of his parents?</p>



<p>If you read Genesis chapter 5, you will see quite clearly that Adam had children BEFORE Seth. Obviously, Cain and Abel were born BEFORE Seth.</p>



<p>Genesis 5:3-4 says:</p>



<p>“Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth: the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and DAUGHTERS.”</p>



<p>Hebrew and Ethiopic theology does NOT record female ancestry, that is why the daughters of Adam, which he had BEFORE Seth, are not named. Scripture just says that he had daughters.</p>



<p>If you read Numbers 1:2, you will see that in the first census ever taken, God asked Moses to count only MALES.</p>



<p>“Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, every male individually.”</p>



<p>In Christ’s ancestry in Mathew 1 and Luke 3, only MALES were recorded. Even when Christ fed the 5 thousand with the two fishes and five loaves in Mark 6, and again, when He fed the 4 thousand in Mark 8, only MALES were mentioned.</p>



<p>Some people have promoted alternative theories of one Lilith and suggested that Cain either married her or her daughters. This is false because there was no Lilith. That story is just some made up nonsense and only goes to show the intelligence of those who believe it.</p>



<p>In those days, people married their sisters. For example, Sarah was Abraham’s sister, as we see in Genesis 20:12:</p>



<p>“Indeed she is truly my sister. She is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.”</p>



<p>Abraham&#8217;s brother Nahor married Milcah, his own niece. We see that in Genesis 11:29. Also, in 2 Samuel 13:13, Tamar asked her brother, Amnon, to ask their father, King David, for permission to marry her.</p>



<p>Adam and Eve had daughters. Cain obviously married his sister, as did the other male children, grandchildren and male descendants of Adam and Eve, who married either their sisters or female cousins.</p>



<p>If you read Genesis 4:17 in the original Hebrew, this is obvious. But not if you read it in English translations, with the exception of the Amplified Version, which reads as follows:</p>



<p>&#8220;Cain knew his wife [one of Adam&#8217;s descendants] and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch; and Cain built a city and named it Enoch, after the name of his son.&#8221;</p>



<p>Initially, the gene pool in Adam and Eve was perfect. However, after the fall, when man lost perfection, the gene pool began to be weaker and weaker until God intervened in Leviticus 18:9:</p>



<p>“The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or the daughter of your mother, whether born at home or elsewhere, their nakedness you shall not uncover.”</p>



<p>Scripture is a perfect book. I have read it from cover to cover in multiple translations. I have also read it in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek.</p>



<p>The challenges that people have with Scripture is that they read it in English, or some other language to which it has been translated to.</p>



<p>If I gave you $100 and you converted it to British Pound Sterling, you would get £75.3. But if you take that £75.3 pounds to a bureau de change, you would not be able to buy back the original $100. You could perhaps buy $98. You see, in the course of conversion, some value is lost.</p>



<p>Now, consider that the King James Version was not translated from original Scripture. It was translated from the Latin Vulgate, which itself was translated from the original codexes. So, instead of buying $98, you are actually buying something like $94.</p>



<p>It is like making a photocopy from another photocopy. You can get an image, but you can’t get a perfect image.</p>



<p>In the course of translating Scripture to English or any other language besides the original languages, some value, or should I say power, is lost.</p>



<p>A good example is Matthew 11:12, which reads in the King James Version as follows:</p>



<p>“And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.”</p>



<p>As a born again Christian in university, my colleagues and I read that verse and began praying ‘dangerous’ prayers to take the Kingdom by force violently.</p>



<p>It was not until I read that verse in Greek that I realised that that was not what it said and that the KJV translators mistranslated it.</p>



<p>If you read that verse in subsequent translations, such as the NIV, NLT, CEV, etc, you will see that it is saying NOTHING of the sort of things that the KJV implied.</p>



<p>For example, this is the same verse in the NIV:</p>



<p>“From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, and violent people have been raiding it.”</p>



<p>Another mistranslated verse is Isaiah 45:11:</p>



<p>“Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.”</p>



<p>I remember that my spiritual colleagues and I were literally obeying God by commanding Him, because He asked us to command Him.</p>



<p>It was not until I read that verse in Hebrew that I realised that that was a question. God was asking us if we had the audacity to command Him concerning the works of His Hand.</p>



<p>Biblical Hebrew has very few punctuations, and it does not have a question mark. So, it is effortless for translators fo turn a question into a licence.</p>



<p>And subsequent translations have since corrected that error in translation. I will now quote the same Isaiah 45:11 in the NLT:</p>



<p>“This is what the LORD says&#8211; the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker: Concerning things to come, do you question me about my children, or give me orders about the work of my hands?”</p>



<p>It is a similar thing that occurred in the case of Cain and his lineage. Because Western culture makes men and women equal, Westerners, and those they colonised, have inserted their bias into Scripture, and because Scripture does not acknowledge women in ancestral lineage, they have been misled into thinking that only males existed on Earth (with the exception of Eve) at the time Cain killed Abel.</p>



<p>That is far from the truth. Very, very, far indeed.</p>



<p>And unless Christians learn from Muslims, and instead of translating Scripture, we translate ourselves, by learning the original language of Scripture, we will keep getting tossed to and fro by translators who may or may not have an agenda.</p>

<p>When you were in university, and your lecturer had to share handouts, but they were not enough, he simply made photocopies from the one he had. Is that not so? Learn from that. When you have money, but it is not sufficient, make photocopies of your money. A business is a money photocopier. An investment is a money photocopier. An asset, such as a house you can rent, is a money photocopier. Stop consuming your original. Photocopy it and consume the photocopies. Invest your earned income. That is your capital. Spend your dividends. Those are your disposable income.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reno Omokri question Labor Party, LP Presidential Candidate, Peter Obi on what he has to tell victims of IPOB activities in the Southeast Following his statement that the groups are not terrorists as federal government of Nigeria label them.</p>



<p>Peter Obi in his recent television interview said that IPOB is not a terrorist organization.</p>



<p>Reacting to the statement, Ex-aides to Former President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri said:</p>



<p>&#8220;After defending IPOB on camera, and saying that they are not terrorists, and that he knows them and lives with them, what will Peter Obi tell our soldiers, policemen, and INEC staff, that have been slaughtered by IPOB? He wants to be a Commander-in-Chief that defends their killers? What will Peter Obi tell the widows and orphans of Nigeria’s security forces that have been killed by IPOB? He called IPOB ‘agitators’ and even said he will ‘dialogue with agitators!’ Can Nigeria be safe in the hands of Peter Obi? Oya IPOB blackmailers, release more blackmail against me for exposing Obi! We go see who go tire!&#8221;</p>

<p>He said:</p>



<p>The only person who can have rallies nationwide is Peter Obi. Not because he is popular nationally. Far from it! It is because people of Southeast origin are in EVERY town in Nigeria, and form his base. They are the most itinerant indigenous ethnicity in Nigeria. And they have very good Town Unions that have received mobilisation from their heartland. If you go anywhere on Earth and you do not see a person of Southeast origin, run from there! Tinubu is wasting his time competing with Peter via rallies. He should learn from Atiku. Focus on the main vote! Rallies do not win elections. What wins elections in Nigeria are structure, and personal connections to the leaders of states, towns and villages. That is how Abiola won in 1993. Between then and now, little has changed.</p>

<p>He said: </p>



<p>Father Mbaka criticised former President Jonathan and he was not punished or banished. Father Mbaka criticised General Buhari and he was not punished or banished. So, why should Father Mbaka be punished and banished after criticising Peter Obi? I may be wrong, but it just seems that what Father Mbaka said about a then incumbent President Jonathan was much worse than what he said about Obi. Father Mbaka lied. He claimed former President Jonathan wanted to kill him (please research it). What is so unique about what Father Mbaka said Obi that warrants his current travails? Can someone please explain the logic behind this without insulting anyone?</p>

<p>He said</p>



<p>The greatest mistake Peter Obi made was getting high on app based polls that predict victory for him. In case you do not know what app based means, it simply means the pollsters behind the poll did it on an app, like Twitter or survey monkey. Why does this matter? Because, Nigeria has a disproportionately higher number of Southerners than Northerners on social media.</p>



<p>Remember that English is used for most apps, which favours Southerners. That is why Northern Nigerian participation on Facebook was minimal, until Facebook integrated Hausa into its app in September of 2016, after Mark Zuckerberg’s August 2016 visit to Nigeria. Other apps have yet to follow suit.</p>



<p>Look at states that did well in INEC’s online voter registration. The top 10 are dominated by Southern states. Now, look at the states that did well in physical registration. Other than Lagos and Oyo, the top 10 are the dominated by Northern states.</p>



<p>If there is one platform Northerners dominate, that medium is radio. That is why the world’s major powers ALL invest in a Hausa language broadcast service.</p>



<p>BBC Hausa, for example, has a weekly audience of 17.7 million. Whereas the highest rating that the BBC has in The UK (its home country) is 14.8 million (BBC Radio 2). App based polls will always disproportionately favour Southern Nigeria, because Northerners are on radio, while Southerners are on social media.</p>



<p>As a Southerner, when last did you tune into radio? As a Northerner, when last, if ever, did you visit Twitter? You see? QED!</p>



<p>It is just like Big Brother Nigeria. The craze fuelling BBNaija is not driven by television perse. It is fuelled by Southern Nigerian youths on social media. BBNaija hardly features in Northern Nigeria. It is a Southern thing.</p>



<p>Anyone who allows himself to get drunk on polls prepared by Southerners and foreigners, who have never lived in Northern Nigeria, as I have, and who assume, wrongly, that one size of poll fits all, is not very knowledgeable about Nigeria. What a great disappointment awaits them in 2023!</p>

<p>A Nigerian living in exile, Reno Omokri has continue to attack the Labor Party, Presidential candidate Peter Obi base on his growing acceptance and popularity when compare to other Presidential candidates.</p>



<p>In a series of his social media post, Reno Omokri discredit Peter Obi, given reasons why Nigerians should not votes for Peter Obi.</p>



<p>He point out that Peter Obi represent IPOB.</p>



<p>He also said that Obi can&#8217;t hold campaign in his own town, because he obey IPOB sit-at-home order.</p>



<p>The last post share yesterday by the same Reno Omokri, point out that Atiku Abubakar is more better educated that Peter Obi.</p>



<p>In his analysis, Omokri said he know both Peter Obi and Atiku Abubakar  very well.</p>



<p>He said:</p>



<p>&#8220;I know both Waziri Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi personally. Atiku is a much better candidate. He is better educated, more successful in business, employs more Nigerians in making made in Nigeria products, and has more political experience, and is more detribalised than Peter. The danger Nigeria will have in electing Obi is because we are not sure of his commitment to one Nigeria. By scrupulously obeying IPOB’s sit at home, his commitment to Nigeria is suspect. However, I urge all those who truly believe in Nigeria’s unity to give Peter Obi the benefit of the doubt. The next time IPOB declares a sit at home in Nigeria’s Southeast, Peter, go to your home state and walk about with a Nigerian flag in defiance of IPOB, then we will know you are for Nigeria! But if you refuse, there is every possibility that you will also obey IPOB if you get to Aso Rock.&#8221;</p>
