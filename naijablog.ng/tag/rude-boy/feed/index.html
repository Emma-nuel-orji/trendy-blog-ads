<p>The news of their pending divorce comes as a massive shock to both families, their close friends and fans. Even since then may people have been blaming Rude Boy or either his wife Anita for the divorce.</p>



<p>Many thinks that Anita is responsible for the defunct P-Square, that she made Rude Boy turn his back on his twin brother and for that, she is not a good woman while many are of the view that Rude Boy is the cause for the pending divorce because someone who can&#8217;t settle with his twin brother, cant keep his family.</p>



<p>Now, who do you blame for the divorce <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>According to Vanguard, the 7-year old marriage of Paul Okoye, one half of defunct music duo P Squarepopularly known as Rude boy and his entrepreneur wife, Anita Okoye has crashed as the latter files a petition for a divorce.</p>



<p>Details surrounding the crash of the marriage came from the leak of the official petition for the divorce which cited “irreconcilable differences” as the basis of the irretrievable break down of the marriage.</p>



<p>She filed for a divorce over irreconcilable differences according to the leaked court documents. And what is IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fb_img_16294755306133883243888499914364-637x630.jpg?resize=637%2C630&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-94012" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>Irreconcilable differences technically means that an individual and their spouse cannot get along with one another enough to keep the marriage alive, and this lack of getting along can cause a whole array of other issues in the marriage.</p>



<p>And when seeking a divorce, a spouse may file for either an “at-fault divorce or a “no-fault divorce”. Stating irreconcilable differences as the grounds for divorce is considered to be a no-fault divorce, meaning that neither spouse is accusing the other of wrongdoings that led to the marriage’s end.</p>



<p>In other words, Paul and Anita divorce, is a peaceful one.</p>

<p>Popular Nigerian singer, Paul Okoye fondly referred to as Rude Boy, has taken to his verified Instagram account to announce that he has contracted coronavirus.</p>



<p>He seized the opportunity to sensitise his followers that COVID 19 is not a hoax. &#8220;Attention!!! Covid is real!!! I know as typical Nigerian or African it is very hard to believe. Some will say &#8216;experience is the best teacher. Oh well, the experience and the teacher has visited me and they’ve been dealing with me for more than 10 days now. It is not funny, worst sickness ever!!! You all better be careful out there. If you like believe me, if you like don’t believe me. You can as well wait for your own experience by playing ignorance. Goodluck. God help us all,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>The singer also went on to share his harrowing experience while battling the virus. He revealed that he will do his final tests tomorrow to know if he is free of the virus.</p>



<p>&#8220;I cannot wait for tomorrow to do my final test, so if they declare me free of the virus, I will know that I am free. Guys stay safe out there. If you see me and want to hug me and I push you, do not be angry, I am not &#8216;forming celebrity&#8217;. Let&#8217;s learn to greet from afar.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is nothing worse than this illness, I understand when you are ill and feeling pain. The usual pain is headache, high temperature, dizziness.

Please be careful out there,&#8221; the singer said.</p>
