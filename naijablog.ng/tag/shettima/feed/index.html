<p>I heartily felicitate His Excellency, former Borno State Governor and Vice Presidential Candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Kashim Shettima, on the occasion of his 56th birthday.</p>



<p>I join other members of our great party, the APC, his friends and family members in rejoicing with my brother and friend, our Vice Presidential Candidate, His Excellency Senator Kashim Shettima, as he marks his birthday.</p>



<p>Senator Shettima is a man of many parts and bundle of energy, as he has demonstrated in his remarkably productive public life.</p>



<p>His record of service as a scholar, banker, two-term Governor of Borno State and currently as a Distinguished Senator representing Borno Central Senatorial District, is exemplary.</p>



<p>The APC Northeast caucus is proud to showcase him as our ambassador and to assure Nigerians that he will do the party and the nation proud as the next Vice President of Nigeria, by the Grace of God.</p>



<p>I pray Allah to grant him long life and good health to continue his service to our fatherland.</p>



<p>Once again, I wish Senator Shettima a happy birthday and many happy returns of the day.</p>

<p>Vice Presidential candidate of the ruling APC has revealed that he delibrately wore the outfit he wore to throw peo­ple off during the campaign.</p>



<p>The former Borno governor said he had received word that there was gang up against him there and so he threw them off with his outfit</p>



<p>&#8220;I was in Lagos for the NBA conference.&#8221;<br />&#8220;It used to hold at Eko Hotel and was largely funded by the APC government of Lagos state&#8221;</p>



<p>He continued;</p>



<p>&#8220;Subsequently, they moved it to Eko Atlantic; a product of an idea sanctioned by Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;One of the candidates, he funded his agents and they held meetings for 3 consecutive nights to cause mischief&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;When I was told that is was a hostile crowd, I delibrately wore sneakers&#8221;</p>

<p>In a bid to prove a point to Nigerians on why they should accept Muslim-Muslim tickets, The APC Vice Presidential candidate, Alhaji K. Shettima has explained that he met a boy named Paul Ojukwu at a store in Abuja about 15 years ago, seeking his help to go to school.</p>



<p>The Borno State former governor said he asked him to bring his results, and when he did, he discovered that they were better than his own, but the little boy couldn&#8217;t go to school because he was poor.</p>



<p>Shettima said he adopted the boy, sent him to the university and got him married without minding his tribe and religion.</p>



<p>He added that the boy, who was standing with him at the podium, is from the Igbo tribe in Anambra, but he never cared about it…</p>

<p>The vice presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Senator Kashim Shettima, has assured Nigerians that when elected, Bola Tinubu, administration would be just, fair and inclusive to all Nigerians, irrespective of tribal, religious and political affiliations.</p>



<p>Shettima stated this on Tuesday at the one year memorial service for Dr. Emmanuel Abiodun, father of Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, held at the St. James Anglican Church, Iperu-Remo, Ikenne Local Government Area, Ogun State.</p>



<p>He said, “We need to build a new nation because the hope of the black man is on Nigeria. The onus is on us to secure the future of our children yet unborn.</p>



<p>“I want to assure Nigerians that we are going to be just and fair to all Nigerians. We are going to be all inclusive because no society can strive on injustice. Ours will be all encompassing, all embracing government.</p>



<p>“We will build a country of our dreams where people are judged by their character irrespective of their political affiliations, religious persuasions, sectional or tribal ground.”</p>
