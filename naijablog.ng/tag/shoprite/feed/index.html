<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-67925" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Assets-.jpg?resize=678%2C482&#038;ssl=1" alt="Shoprite neck deep in debt, barred from transferring assets" width="678" height="482" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Shoprite has been barred from transferring or getting rid of its assets out of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The Federal High Court in Lagos made an order of mareva injunction stopping Shoprite Checkers (PTY) Limited from taking such actions over a $10m judgment debt.</p>
<p>When Shoprite announced its plan to exit Nigeria, the mareva injunction was made by Justice Mohammed Liman in favour of a Nigerian firm, A.I.C. Limited, which in 2018, secured a $10m judgment against Shoprite in a breach of contract lawsuit.</p>
<p>According to court papers, the $10m judgment was entered in favour of A.I.C. Limited against Shoprite by Justice Lateef Lawal-Akapo of the Lagos State High Court in Ikeja.</p>
<p>Displeased with the judgment, Shoprite went on appeal but it lost at the Court of Appeal and has gone to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In the July 14, 2020 mareva injunction, Justice Liman restrained</p>
<p>“the judgment debtor/1st respondent,” and its privies “from transferring, assigning, charging, disposing of its trademark, franchise and intellectual property in a manner that will alter, dissipate or remove these non-cash assets and other assets, including but not limited to trade receivables, trade payables, payment for purchase of merchandise, from within the jurisdiction of this honourable court.”</p>
<p>The judge also mandated the 2nd respondent, Retail Supermarket Nigeria Limited,</p>
<p>“to disclose its audited financial statements for the years ending 2018 and 2019 to enable the judgment creditor/applicant determine the judgment debtor’s/respondent’s funds in its custody in order to preserve same in satisfaction of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Appeal No: CA/L/288/2018.”</p>
<p>A.I.C. Limited had in 2012 sued Shoprite Checkers (PTY) Limited; and Retail Supermarket Nigeria Limited for alleged breach of contract.</p>
<p>The Nigerian firm said it was the one, who invited the South African retail supermarket operators to Nigeria and opened their eyes to business opportunities in the country, with a view that they would go into a joint venture.</p>
