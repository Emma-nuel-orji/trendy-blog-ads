<p>The message share on her official social media handle read :Blessed fruit of my womb. Drinker of my milk. Climber of my body. Sleep stopper. Scatterer of my things. Best dancer. Blessing bringer. Lil Miss I-have-a-mind-of-my-own. Overall best in eating paper. Cheerful Giver even when I don&#8217;t want. Beauty Queen. My little butterfly. My Child. Omo mi. Ayanfe mi. Onife mi. Love of my life. I love you so much Adejare. So much. You&#8217;re the best thing in all my life. You make me so proud of myself. I would do anything for you. Everything. For you. You will never doubt that no one in the world could possibly love you like I do. Sometimes I will do too much, but it will be because I love you too much.</p>

<p>I bless you with my heart, with my love, with my spirit. As your MOTHER I bless you in the way that only a mother can. I bless you truly, completely, unconditionally. You will never suffer. You will never lack any good thing. Favour will never leave you. Anyone that knows and encounters you, from near or afar will bless you. You are the light of the world my angel. Evil will not see you. God is for you &#8211; Nothing against you can prosper. I shield you with the angels of God. All your life, you will abide under the shadow of the Almighty. You will know and love God for yourself. I cover you with the LOVE God has intoxicated me with for you. Glory to God for the testimony of you. All in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>



<p>My baby is ONE. Oh My God. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f62d.png" alt="üò≠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I&#8217;m so excited to see you Blossom and Grow. Your Nana has been an incredible mother to me, and by the grace of God, I will surpass that and be an even better mom to you. Your dad and I are so proud of you. He looks at you often and says to me &#8220;Baby, look what we made.&#8221; And really, look what we made. Happy birthday baby.</p>
