<p>When I first met my husband, I didn‚Äôt know he was singing because me I already said I cannot marry a singer. I didn‚Äôt know he was singing, I think he was even a fan,‚Äù Simi said.</p>

<p>Singer Simi countered President Muhammadu Buhari who said that Nigeria don&#8217;t have money to cater for education</p>



<p>In her her tweet read: ‚ÄúHigher institutions on strike for months almost, if not every, year. The odds are always stacked against the average Nigerian. You spend the first half of your life just trying to survive.</p>



<p>‚ÄúTaking away the hopes and dreams of the youth. Destroying their futures so they‚Äôre ready to settle for crumbs. Just so they can live to see the next day and fight for more crumbs. Because they‚Äôre not your<br />own children, their futures don‚Äôt matter? Shame on you!</p>



<p>‚ÄúIf the leaders in our own country cannot have compassion on their own people, then what can we really do? They get into power and abuse it, abuse the people they should be serving. ‚Äú</p>



<p>Taking a swipe at the government, Simi said: ‚ÄúThe rest of the world laughing at the so-called giant of Africa. Shame on all of you!!</p>



<p>‚ÄúImagine doing a four-year course for eight years but still no job. This wickedness is too much.&#8221; She wrote.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the week, news made the rounds that celebrity couple, Simi and Adekunle Gold had welcomed their first child in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In light of this, many of their fans thronged to their social media handles to congratulate and celebrate the award-winning songstress who had announced that she was expecting her first child through her latest single titled, ‚ÄòDuduke‚Äô.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, when news reporters reached out to a close source to the couple who preferred anonymity, the source confirmed that Simi was currently abroad with her husband and mother but had not put to bed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The source, while thanking fans for the congratulatory messages, noted that the couple would announce the birth of their child when it happens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚ÄúSimi is still pregnant but she will give birth any time from now. We are expecting the news at any moment. Her family is with her abroad. She was there before the release of ‚ÄòDuduke‚Äô video. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Right now, she has slowed down with some of her works but she has not given birth. Whenever Simi puts to bed, everybody would know,‚Äù the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple has always kept part of their private life out of the social media space. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their 2019 wedding was a private affair which was attended by only close family and friends who didn‚Äôt share photos or videos of the couple or the wedding ceremony on social media.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fans, however, caught a glimpse of the wedding when the couple released a music video that captured some of the joyful moments.</span></p>
