										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nigerian upcoming singer has taken to his Twitter page to poke fun at his female compatriots who no longer posting photos of themselves eating luxury meals during the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>In what appeared to be a direct shade aimed at slay queens who depend on ‚Äòdestiny helpers‚Äô, the Twitter user and upcoming artiste wondered if Nigerian ladies have suddenly ran out of food at home.</p>
<p>Questioning nobody in particular, he asked if they have food but have no meat in their meals during lockdown.</p>
<p>In his words;</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúLadies are not posting food during this lockdown oh. No food at home?? Or there‚Äôs no meat inside? You are cutting fish into 2 with your sister?‚Äù</p></blockquote>
