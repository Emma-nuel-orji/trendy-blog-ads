<p>On our Naijablog talk zone section, today 7th of July 2022, we will be looking at the recent attacks on Kuje Prison.</p>



<p>Report has it that before the attack, Soldiers mounting security at the prison where removed.</p>



<p>That means, someone know about the Attack.</p>



<p>The President has visited the prison, and he asked series of questions.</p>



<p>This are some of his questions below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fb_img_16571323603584316629738878995105-550x630.jpg?resize=550%2C630&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-116257" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>Didn&#8217;t you thinks Nigerian security services chief have questions to answers in regards to the incident?</p>



<p>Kuje Prison attack isn&#8217;t the first, last months, over 30 Christian worshipers where killed by the same terrorist in Ondo State.</p>



<p>Even the day, Kuje prison is under Attack, the same terrorist attack President Muhammadu Buhari Convoys in Katsina.</p>



<p>The same day terrorist killed high rank police officer in Katsina State.</p>



<p>Isn&#8217;t all this attack not enough for the President to sack all the security chiefs?</p>

<p>As the election draw Closer, Nigerian Politicians seeking for Presidency has gone to associate with Late President Umar Musa Yar&#8217;adua mother.</p>



<p>Umar Musa Yar&#8217;adua, the most respected President in the History of Nigeria died in office with his seven points agenda.</p>



<p>Despite his ill health status when he was the president, he was ables to carry all Nigerians along irrespective of tribes and Religion.</p>



<p>Because of that, Nigerian Politicians troops to seek for mama blessings when election is around the corner.</p>



<p>Wike, Atiku Abubakar, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, and Peter Obi has visited mama just to seek her motherly blessings.</p>



<p>For me, I think they should allow mama rest, because if his son didn&#8217;t do well for Nigerians no one will visit her.</p>



<p>What did you think? </p>

<p>Election is fast approaching, Violence, Ethnic hatred, Religion Crisis is on the raise in Nigeria.<br />That is Nigerian Politicians usuals way of keeping the masses devided to achieve their aim.</p>



<p>Last week, there was religious uproar, when a young lady Deborah Samuel, Christian girl was Killed in Sokoto State for alleged Blasphemy.</p>



<p>As the tesion raise, Many Nigerian Politicians from the North Supported the killing, because they believe with that they can win Northerners votes.<br />Why Southeast and Southwest Politicians remain silent because they didn&#8217;t want to stain their political ambition.</p>



<p>Atiku Abubakar, tweet against it, but later deleted the tweet over Threat.<br />He was threaten that he will not get votes from Sokoto State and others Northern States, just because he kicked against Killing of Innocent girl.</p>



<p>Today Igbo and Hausa Clash In Abuja, billions Naira Properties belong to Igbos Traders where set Ablaze.</p>



<p>Now another ethnic tension has been set up from this incident.</p>



<p>And I believe no politician will said anything about it because they don&#8217;t want anything that will affect their political ambition.</p>



<p>It sad and painful that when election is coming closer, they find what will divide the masses so that they can achieve their aims.</p>



<p>Because they know very well that when the masses are divided, they can be easily manipulated.</p>



<p>But the sad reality is that, After the election, all of us, will suffered.</p>



<p>Igbos man will not reduce the price of his commodities for you in the market because you an Igbo Man.</p>



<p>Hausa man will reduce his own for you because you an Hausa man.</p>



<p>So why is that, we refuse to understand this our Politicians strategies by now?</p>



<p>Has the pain Buhari government made us pass didn&#8217;t add any Sense to us?</p>



<p>Nigerians, how long will we continue like this?</p>



<p>How long will politicians keep, keeping us devided so that they can achieve their aims?</p>
