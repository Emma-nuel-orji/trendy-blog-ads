<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Media Personality, Toke Makinwa reveal the real definition of strong woman by Nigerian Men&#8217;s.</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Toke Makinwa has taken to her Twitter handle to knock Nigerian men of what they actually describe as a strong woman.</h3>



<p>In a tweet she made on the 31th of May 2022, Makinwa said that Nigerian men describe strong woman base on her ability to endure abuse, bad Behavior and suffering.</p>



<p>She tweet:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Nigerian men‚Äôs definition of a strong woman is long suffering, emotional abuse and a high tolerance of accepting bad behavior. You‚Äôll hear them say ‚Äúshe turned the boy in me into a man‚Äù, that means her name is endurance, the woman has endured <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="üòÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="üòÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="üòÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.</p></blockquote>



<p>In another tweet Makinwa blame the society for encouraging such action.</p>



<p>According to her:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Society encourages that sort of narrative, women are seen as strong by the amount of BS she‚Äôs has to endure till the man was ready to give her peace. When they meet the women who stand up for themselves? Society labels them as wayward and too opinionated. Who is Society again?</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>They automatically think being alone at a certain age means you are miserable <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="üòÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="üòÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="üòÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="üòÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. Would you not rather be 55 and alone than enduring BS with someone? If that‚Äôs the definition of miserable, a beg which one will you rather be?</p></blockquote>

<p>TV host, Toke Makinwa, has revealed that her expectations of any man she would be in a relationship with are very high.</p>



<p>She stated what her expectations are on Tuesday via posts on her Instagram Story.</p>



<p>Makinwa boasted that she had become her own knight in shining armour, hence any man who wants to come into her life would have to give her the moon.</p>



<p>Her posts read, ‚ÄúAt this rate, I can definitely say I‚Äòve become the knight in shining armour I‚Äôve always dreamt of. Feels so good to be so empowered to do for me what I once thought I needed someone to. The bar is set extremely high too.</p>



<p>‚ÄúSimply put, it will take a lot, so much more to impress me cos(sic) I‚Äôve saved myself so much in this lifetime, to give up my comfort and peace of mind for any man. You‚Äôve got to bring me the moon. Better still evacuate the earth and give it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reports filtered in online yesterday that AMCON seized a house belonging to Toke Makinwa in a series of related events.</p>
<p>However, the media personality has debunked the online reports claiming that her Ikoyi home had been repossessed by the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria.</p>
<p>On July 27, Twitter Nigeria went wild after some users of the app claimed that her &#8221;Banana Island property&#8221; had been taken over by the Asset management corporation.</p>
<p>However, a statement released last night by her publicist, Andrea Manuela Giaccaglia, states that Toke is the sole owner of her Ikoyi property and that it has not been confiscated as rumored.</p>
<p>The statement adds that legal action will be taken against the originators of the report that her house has been seized.</p>
<p>The statement reads,</p>
<p>&#8221;On behalf of Ms. Toke Makinwa, we would like to address the rumour circulating the internet that Ms. Toke Makinwa‚Äôs alleged house in Banana Island was taken over by the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON).</p>
<p>Ms. Toke‚Äôs is the sole owner of her residence in Ikoyi.</p>
<p>Our lawyers have been contacted and legal action will be taken against the originators of this story.</p>
<p>Kind Regards<br />
Toke Makinwa‚Äôs Management&#8221;</p>
