<p>Social media platform, Twitter, has finally released its highly requested Edit Tweet feature.</p>



<p>This comes after many years of request and it will be available first to some paying Twitter subscribers later in September.</p>



<p>According to Twitter, the feature is currently undergoing “internal testing.”</p>



<p>“Tweets will be able to be edited a few times in the 30 minutes following their publication,” according to a Twitter blog post. “Edited Tweets will appear with an icon, timestamp, and label so it’s clear to readers that the original Tweet has been modified.”</p>

<p>The former boss and co-founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, has hailed Elon Musk&#8217;s acquisition of the platform.</p>



<p>Reacting to the $44 billion deal, Dorsey tweeted, &#8220;In principle, I don’t believe anyone should own or run Twitter. It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company. Solving the problem of it being a company, however, Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.</p>



<p>&#8220;Elon’s goal of creating a platform that is “maximally trusted and broadly inclusive” is the right one. This is also #paraga’s goal, and why I chose him. Thank you both for getting the company out of an impossible situation. This is the right path…I believe it with all my heart.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m so happy Twitter will continue to serve the public conversation. Around the world, and into the stars!&#8221;</p>

<p>For those who do not want to do things in ignorance, please note that Nigeria is protesting the bias of Twitter towards it. Some want to deceive you, with their long essays written in well-polished English, that it is about taking down the President&#8217;s tweet. No! Not at all!</p>



<p>It is much bigger and more complicated than that. It is about Twitter allowing a few persons to use their platform to threaten the peace and sovereignty of over 200 million people by spewing hate and inciting violence, at the same time, denying our government the opportunity to warn these few miscreants. You may say that the government should have let this slide &#8220;since it was just once.&#8221; You may even say that the FG has used a sledgehammer to kill a fly, but remember that you have attacked the FG for being slow and weak in handling little issues until they grow bigger than it can handle, something I also hate about it.</p>



<p>Twitter banned the President of its own country for using their medium to encourage insurrection in their own country but allowed the Kanus and Omokris to encourage genocide in Nigeria. I promise you that if these people had made even close to similar tweets inciting Nigerians living in the US against the US government, Twitter would not only have taken down their tweets, but would have also banned them from all social media platforms and the US government would have included them in their terror watchlist.</p>



<p>Well, I believe that the suspension of Twitter by the FG is temporary and is just a protest against the &#8216;involuntary&#8217; role of Twitter in setting this country ablaze (there is serious punishment for involuntary manslaughter even in law).</p>



<p>You can insult, attack and curse all day. The only thing we learn from that is that you value your Twitter account more than this country. It is clear that you do not care even if this country will burn to ashes as long as you will continue to tweet.</p>



<p>If you are outraged that you have been temporarily blocked from socialising, note that some people have, as a result of the activities of some on the same medium, been permanently blocked from this life.</p>



<p>Therefore, our message to you is simple &#8211; there was Nigeria before you and Twitter and there will be Nigeria far after you and Twitter. There will not just be Nigeria, there will be a better Nigeria! &#8211; mansur Isah buhari</p>

<p>The senior special assistant on Media and Publicity to president Muhammadu Buhari, Garba Shehu has debunk the allegation that he comment on the choice of Ghana as Africa Base for twitter over Nigeria, the African giant.</p>



<p>Shehu in a twitter says that he never comment, nor the Presidency speak on the development.</p>



<p>He tweet &#8220;I did not comment on the Twitter choice of Ghana as their Africa base. There are many who have the same names with me. It will be mistaken of anyone to attribute a quote to me or even the Presidency that my verified handles did not bear.&#8221;</p>



<p>Twitter, one of the world popular social media today announced Ghana as their choice destination to locate it Africa headquarter.</p>



<p>The announcement was said to have generate different reaction from Nigerians on the web over the choice of Ghana to Nigeria, the African giant.</p>

<p>A student of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso, has reportedly spent 54 days of detention in police custody for setting up a Twitter parody account of the former President Goodluck Jonathan.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_20200718_013548.jpg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-60776" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>Parody accounts are permitted by Twitter and are often named after prominent individuals but mainly used for comic purposes relative to unfolding issues in the sociopolitical space of their subjects.</p>



<p>According to Punch, Babatunde Olushola was arrested on May 23, 2020 after the former president filed a complaint with Mohammed Adamu, the inspector-general of police, who would later mobilise for his arrest.</p>



<p>Tope Akinyode, a human rights lawyer, was quoted to have said that the policemen obtained information on Olusola’s call log record from a telecommunications service provider.</p>



<p>As his call history linked him to his uncle, who happened to be a pastor in Ogbomoso, operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) made the clergyman invite him for arrest.</p>



<p>Olushola was thereafter taken to Abuja where he was charged for impersonation and contravening the Cybercrime (Prohibition, Prevention, Etc) Act of 2015.</p>



<p><em>“I was informed that it was one of the aides to former President Jonathan that saw the account. Jonathan immediately reported to the IG and that was how investigations began,”</em> Akinyode said.</p>



<p>While calls for Olusola’s release have increased on social media over the past few days, his bail was fixed at N500,000 and a civil servant of not less than level 15 is expected to stand as his surety.</p>



<p><em>“Olusola has no parents and has not been able to meet the bail conditions hence his continued detention. However, we believe he will be out soon,” </em>Akinyode added.</p>



<p>For parody, Twitter’s policy requires that bios clearly indicate the user isn’t affiliated with the subject and that the account name shows the user isn’t the same person as the account’s subject.</p>



<p>On Olusola’s Twitter page, which has now been suspended, the ex-president’s photo can be seen with the name “Goodluck E. Jonathan”.</p>



<p>The user however informed his 46,400 followers that the account was a parody one with his profile reading, “BrezzisLife, not GEJ.”</p>



<p>Olusola was said to have used the account to make inciting comments about Jonathan’s wife, Dame Patience Ebele Jonathan.</p>

<p>Twitter has temporarily suspended verified accounts from posting on the platform after a major cryptocurrency scam that took place a day ago.</p>
<p>It was reported that about $10m was stolen by bitcoin scammers in what is considered the biggest heist on the social media platform.</p>
<p>The scam targeted several high-profile users including Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Kanye West, and several company accounts, including Apple and Square’s Cash App, Twitter Support, among others.⁣<br />
⁣<br />
A night ago, scammers took control of the accounts and asked users to send $1,000 to a Bitcoin account with the promise of doubling their deposit in return.</p>
