<p>Large Consignment Cocaine ship from Nigeria intercepted and seized in United Kingdom.</p>



<p class="first">The 500gm of cocaine from Nigeria that was been shipped to India when it was seized on Tuesday, according to UK official.</p>



<p>The internationally coordinated effort, which lasted from September 14 to October 11, led to 178 seizures across the globe.</p>



<p>According to customs officials in Britain, 174,400 sildenafil tablets entered the UK from India.</p>



<p>Drugs were not the only items seized. Animal skin, live reptiles and elephant tusks were part of the confiscated products.</p>



<p>Britain&#8217;s minister for Immigration Compliance and the Courts, Chris Philp, said: &#8220;Organised crime groups drive the trade in endangered species and the movement of banned animal products is key to how they operate.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is why Border Force&#8217;s specialist officers will continue their vital work at the border to prevent the importation and exportation of endangered animals and plants, as well as working alongside enforcement partners such as the National Wildlife Crime Unit, and police from across the UK to eradicate this ruthless and exploitative trade.&#8221;</p>



<p>The operation was co-led by the World Customs Organisation and Interpol, Hindustan Times reports.</p>



<p>It also involved police, customs, environment, wildlife and forestry agencies from 111 countries.</p>



<p>Aside from the drugs, the contraband items impounded included 1.3 tonnes of ivory, more than one tonne of Pangolin scales, 1,400 live turtles and 1,800 reptiles.</p>



<p>The news outlet reports that the seizure of sildenafil tablets from India meant to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) is the second such major UK seizure in two years.</p>



<p>The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency seized 3.5 million such pills worth £10 million in 2019, 96 per cent of them were shipped from India.</p>



<p>ED pills are available through pharmacies on a doctor&#8217;s prescription after an assessment.</p>



<p>Illegal traders posing as legitimate suppliers sell unlicensed medications for the UK market online, offering attractive prices, officials said.</p>

<p>The story sound unbelievable, but it happened</p>



<p>Man allegedly send his wife of 8 years packing, then married his own mother in-law.</p>



<p>Read the full story below that was reported by Mirror UK.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200917_101110_116.jpg?w=678&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-72500" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p></p><cite>Clive Bunden and his wife Brenda Clive Bunden and his wife Brenda, from Warrington, Cheshire, have now been together for more than three decades, despite the fact that he was married to her daughter Irene in 1977 The Mirror UK reports that they have been together for more than three decades, married 13 years and are still blissfully happy, despite the unconventional start to their relationship.</cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p></p><cite>For Clive Blunden’s wife Brenda used to be his mother-in-law. He was even arrested after he asked her to marry him but, undeterred, they made history when the law was changed in 2007 and they tied the knot. It is fair to say their unusual coupling raised a few eyebrows. But 10 years on, they have no regrets. “People thought we wouldn’t last but we are stronger than ever,” said Clive, 65. “We’re together 24/7 and there’s a magic to it.” Brenda, 77, added: “Clive is a gentleman and he looks after me. I can get a bit argumentative but he quietens me down.” Brenda wasn’t such a fan of Clive when he got together with her daughter Irene. In fact, she disliked him the moment she saw him. Clive and Irene married in 1977 and had daughters Sarah and Tanya before divorcing in 1985. Four years later, Clive and Brenda began dating in secret. “We fell in love,” said Brenda. “One night, he took me for a drink and we ended up kissing.”</cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p></p><cite>In 1997, they decided to marry. But a few days after they put their banns up at the register office in their hometown of Warrington, Cheshire, Clive was arrested. He was told there was a “lawful impediment” to marrying his mother-in-law and warned he could be jailed for up to seven years if they went ahead with it. Because Brenda’s first husband, Richard, had passed away and Irene remarried, they wrongly assumed they would be free to wed. Instead, they had to settle for Brenda changing her surname to Clive’s by deed poll. But this wasn’t good enough for the smitten groom-to-be, who began campaigning for the 500-year-old law to be altered. “I thought we should be married because we had been through everything together,” he explained. “We were being stopped unfairly. I didn’t think it was right, so I wanted to change it.” It was 10 years before a European court ruled a ban on in-laws marrying was a violation of human rights. “I remember when we heard the news on the TV, in September 2005,” said Clive. “I went down on one knee straight away and proposed to Brenda. I had tears in my eyes.” On March 17, 2007, they finally became husband and wife at Warrington register office – the same place where Clive had married Irene 30 years earlier. The majority of their families, including Irene, did not wish to attend. Only one distant relative sent them a congratulations card. Clive, who serenaded Brenda with a rendition of Westlife’s You Raise Me Up, said: “It was a very emotional day. “It had been a struggle to get to that point but it was a wonderful day and we will always remember it.” Brenda said: “Our families didn’t come because they didn’t agree with it. But all we cared about was being with each other.” The newlyweds headed off for a month-long honeymoon in Spain – but after hitting headlines, they were instantly recognised. Brenda said: “We went to Benidorm thinking we’d get away from it all. “We got to the apartments and, God help me, they all knew who we were. “The barman said, ‘Oooh, we’ve got celebs’. But everyone was really nice about it, we had a fantastic honeymoon.” And thankfully, married life was everything they had hoped for. Clive said: “Marriage to Brenda has definitely changed me. I felt different straight away. “I was more relaxed. Until we got married I felt something was missing. “We’ve been through a lot so to come out of it the other end is an achievement. “What made it perfect for me is we can be on our own all day and still get along. We would do it all again.” Brenda said: “Clive is caring and lovable and he looks after me very well. “We do argue and I think I have always been a challenge to Clive. But it is about give and take and trust. “He does have some bad habits. His nail-biting drives me mad. I still joke about how much I disliked him when he was going out with my daughter and became my son-in-law. “We don’t go out of our way to tell strangers how we met and when we do they don’t believe us. “A lot of people thought it wouldn’t last but we can’t live without each other.” On holiday to Benidorm earlier this year, Brenda had a health scare. “Oxygen wasn’t getting to my heart and they had to put a pacemaker in,” she said. “Thankfully, I’m doing smashing now.  Clive’s my carer – he does everything for me. We’re still so happy.” Source: Mirror UK</cite></blockquote>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The death sentence passed on a Kano musician, Yahaya Sharif-Aminu, by a Shari’a court on the grounds of blasphemy has been opposed by the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The UK said that individuals had the right to freely express opinions and peacefully challenge authorities, noting that this was essential to a free and open society.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Shari’a court had imposed the death sentence on Sharif-Aminu, aged 22, for committing blasphemy against Prophet Mohammed in a song he circulated via WhatsApp.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The decision had sparked nationwide outrage, with different civil society groups condemning the court’s decision.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Shari’a Council, however, urged Governor Umar Ganduje of Kano State to sign the death warrant.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But commenting on the sentence in response to an inquiry from our correspondent on Wednesday, the British High Commission in Nigeria said it would continue to monitor the situation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an emailed response by the Senior Press and Public Affairs Officer, British High Commission, Christopher Ogunmodede, the Mission said the UK Government opposes death penalty in all circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It read, </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The United Kingdom is firmly committed to promoting and protecting the right to freedom of religion or belief around the world, and to being a strong voice internationally in defence of this fundamental right.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We believe that the rights of individuals to express opinions and peacefully challenge authorities are essential to a free and open society. We will continue to monitor the situation closely. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is a longstanding policy of the UK Government to oppose the death penalty, in all circumstances, as a matter of principle.”</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is official that the UK has gone into recession for the first time in 11 years and this can be attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the Office for National Statistics, the UK gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have fallen by a record 20.4% in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020, marking the second consecutive quarterly decline after GDP fell by 2.2% in the previous quarter (Jan to Mar) 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This recession&#8217;s been described as two straight quarters of economic decline since 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The deputy national statistician for economic statistics, Jonathan Athow said that the economy bounced back in June after the monthly gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 8.7% following growth of 2.4% in May 2020, but it wasn&#8217;t enough to recover the lost output earlier in the year. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The economy began to bounce back in June with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and housebuilding continuing to recover.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite this, gross domestic product (GDP) in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.&#8221;</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">The ONS said that the decline in output was driven by the shutdown of shops, hotels, restaurants, schools, and car repair shops.</span></li>
