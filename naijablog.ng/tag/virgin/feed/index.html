<p>Also we know woman reproductive system has expiring period.</p>



<p>The expiring period of women reproductive system is when she reaches her menopause.</p>



<p>At these period, the woman can&#8217;t give birth to children anymore.</p>



<p>Most women menopause start at the age of 45 years.</p>



<p>Some begins their menopause at earlier age, which is within 40 years of age, while some at 50 years, they are still seeing their menstruation.</p>



<p>Every woman at 40 years of age, is close to her menopause, that means be it virgin or not when she 40 years old, she is close to her menopause</p>

<p>Naijablog come across a post that described virgin girl as wife material.</p>



<p>According to the post published by vanguard community, it stated that virgin lady make a better wife than those lady that are not virgin.</p>



<p>The post read:</p>



<p>A man has submitted that virgins make better wives.</p>



<p>The man identified as Neo gave his opinion on social media.</p>



<p>In a lengthy tweet, he mentioned that 95% of men married to virgins enjoy their marriages because there’s no baggage such as jumping from one man to another or committing series of abortions in the past.</p>



<p><em>“I know a guy who is not so big, pleaded with his virgin wife that he wouldn’t want childbirth to ruin their sex life so they made a decision to give birth to all their 3 kids through CS. They currently have 2 girls and one boy. We are marrying virgins,Talk another thing please.</em></p>



<p><em>The most important thing in marriage is finding someone that will be a “PARTNER” in all the real sense of the word. A pharmacist I know married a nurse, pleaded with her to leave her high paying job and take care of the kids till they all go to boarding school. She gladly agreed.</em></p>



<p><em>All these standards people set online are from a place of hurt &amp; bitterness most times,people are making their marriage work for them in their own way by making a whole lot of sacrifice. Oh less I forget to mention,the nurse too was a virgin. Virgins make better brides generally.</em></p>



<p><em>If these two guys I mentioned had married Non virgins who spent their prime jumping from one penis to the other,committing abortions and receiving enough heartbreaks, they would have been bitter because of past relationships and not agree to their husband’s pleas. TEAM VIRGIN.</em></p>



<p><em>Literally 95% of men I know that married virgins are enjoying their marriage. No exes to worry about, nobody telling you that you have small d*** and don’t last long because their exes had bigger dicks and lasted longer.</em></p>



<p><em>No bitterness, no feminism, just Pure Love and vibes. People want what they want and how we feel about it is not their business. He doesn’t want a girl with a borehole Vagina and that is more than enough reason to marry a virgin.</em></p>



<p><em>How people on social media feel about it is not his business. As if girls don’t want men with big dicks because they believe having sex with a man with big d*** makes the baby come out faster and the delivery painless. It is the most ignorant thing I ever heard because no d*** is as big as a baby but to them their reason is valid and no one is judging them for it.”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/img_20210819_085804_2071447571633935541914-378x630.jpg?resize=378%2C630&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-93946" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>It it true, can how did virginity has in connection with attitude?</p>



<p>In my own part, where am living I have seen a small girl that is still a Virgin, but she can, lies, stealing is number 1 character, and do more than what an adult lady can&#8217;t do.</p>



<p>If this girl become a lady, and she is married as a Virgin, will she turn out to be a good wife?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This question might have cross some of you guys mind, if actually virgins do feel the urge of wanting more than usual after their first Intercourse.</p>
<p>People do say they lack control for a moment and after constantly do that stuff, then they might be able to generate self-control after it.</p>
<p>Actually, this thought (question) came from a movie I watched, “My Village Virgin Wife”, a Nollywood drama, very funny and interesting. I&#8217;m sure some of you guys might have watched but if you haven&#8217;t, you kinda missing.</p>
<p>But not only that movie, there are some few or even many movies saying virgins do have an insatiable sexual urge for a couple of time after their first intercourse.</p>
<p>On a temporary thought, I think they do have these urges due to the fact that it&#8217;s their first and the pleasure that comes from it is overwhelming and temporary and with the brain receiving this new signal, it might want to receive more to actually understand it.</p>
<p>And there comes the urge for wanting more of it but actually what I wrote above is just a thought and might be not a fact.</p>
<p>So, I and some virgins and some few others seemingly for this knowledge would like to know if actually it&#8217;s true that virgins do have an insatiable sexual urge after their first intercourse or not and also if it&#8217;s a good thing or moreover can led to something else if not properly managed well.</p>
<p>Please do share your thoughts on this matter, the comment section is down believe. We would love to see what you have in mind.</p>
