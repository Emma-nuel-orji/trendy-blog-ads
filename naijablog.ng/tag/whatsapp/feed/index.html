<p>Easy to send and fun to listen to, voice messages have become a go-to for many when sharing funny anecdotes or heartfelt messages with friends and family. With 7 billion voice messages sent on WhatsApp every day, they are a popular way of sharing in-the-moment updates, with the added expressiveness that comes with speech. Voice messages are protected by end-to-end encryption, to keep your personal messages secure at all times.</p>



<p>But as quick as it is to swipe and send a voice message, they should be shared with thought. Receiving long rambles that could take ten minutes to listen to, or playing a message from a parent out loud on public transport is neither fun nor convenient. And what about the politics of replying? Must you respond to a voice message with one of your own?</p>



<p>To help navigate voice message etiquette, WhatsApp has shared tops tips on how to voice message like a pro:</p>



<ol type="1"><li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Don’t record a podcast:</strong>&nbsp;While everyone has a different opinion on the ideal length of a voice message, try keeping them to 1 or 2 minutes. If it’s too long to type but too short for a call, you’ve found the voice message sweet spot. And if you receive a voice message that is unbearably long, you can play it at 1.5x or 2x speeds to listen to it faster.</li></ol>



<ol type="1" start="2"><li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Break it up:&nbsp;</strong>If you really can’t shorten your message, consider breaking it up into shorter ones and sending them separately. Your recipient can choose to binge-listen in one sitting or squeeze them in around their schedule.</li></ol>



<ol type="1" start="3"><li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Respect others:</strong>&nbsp;Be aware of your surroundings when listening to a voice message. Loud playback can be annoying for those around you, but the message may also contain private information. Keep the volume down or use headphones in quiet, crowded places like train carriages.</li></ol>



<ol type="1" start="4"><li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Cut the questions:&nbsp;</strong>Be mindful of how many questions you ask in a single voice note so your recipient doesn’t forget half of them when trying to reply.</li></ol>



<ol type="1" start="5"><li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Return the favour:</strong>&nbsp;If you receive a voice message, try sending one back. A two-way voice conversation is much better than a one-sided rant.</li></ol>



<ol type="1" start="6"><li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Be timely:&nbsp;</strong>Remember to reply to voice messages in a timely manner. If you’re really tight for time, you can send a voice message hands-free while multi-tasking. Simply hold down the microphone icon and swipe up to lock your recording in place. When finished, tap to send.</li></ol>



<p><strong><em>According to WhatsApp, “</em></strong><em>Technology has helped us communicate in an informal, relaxed manner with family and friends, and voice messages over WhatsApp are a popular way to share a funny anecdote, or a heartfelt message &#8211; particularly as they’re protected by end-to-end encryption. That said, at times we can forget the importance of etiquette in digital situations, and there are no official rules to guide us. I’m excited to share some etiquette tips, to help you and the people you’re sharing them with get the best from voice messaging”.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>WhatsApp has always provided people with the ability to connect faster. From enabling people to reach out to friends to stay in touch with family, WhatsApp has strengthened relationships in many ways and improved communication for many people.</p>



<p>Now, for people and businesses globally, WhatsApp is&nbsp; where business gets done. It doesn’t matter whether the business is a small virtual shop or a Fortune 500 company, businesses of all sizes today can rely on WhatsApp to connect with and help their customers and ultimately grow their business.</p>



<p>If you run a small, fast-growing business or a large, global-focused enterprise, your business can benefit from WhatsApp in many ways. Here are some key ways small, medium-scale and large businesses can leverage WhatsApp to grow.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Explore unique features for fast-growing businesses with the WhatsApp&nbsp; Business app</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PIX1-965x630.png?resize=678%2C443&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-116820" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>Designed especially for small businesses, one feature of the WhatsApp Business app that many fast-growing businesses across the world have leveraged for managing communication with their customers is the click-to-chat link.</p>



<p>This feature enables businesses to generate a chat link directly from the WhatsApp Business app and share it across their online presence so that their customers can easily send them messages and receive feedback immediately. This gives businesses the ability to be easily reached while also giving customers control of the businesses they chat with.</p>



<p>Other tools that businesses of all sizes can leverage on the WhatsApp Business app include:</p>



<p><strong>Quick Replies</strong>: Businesses can create shortcuts of responses to questions frequently received from customers on WhatsApp Business to fast-track the process of addressing relevant concerns from their customers.</p>



<p><strong>Away Messages</strong>: It is easier for businesses to manage expectations with their customers who send messages past business hours with Away Messages. Now you can let your customers know when your business is closed and when operations will be open again, to manage their expectations.</p>



<p><strong>Labels</strong>: Organise and filter relevant communication with your customers to enable you to find and respond to messages faster.</p>



<p><strong>Catalog</strong>: With Catalog, businesses can showcase products and services in a mobile storefront and group similar items into collections to make it simpler for customers to shop. You can go ahead and share links to your entire catalog or specific items with new and existing customers on WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram from within the WhatsApp Business app.</p>



<p>Across Africa, small, medium-scale and large businesses are leveraging the WhatsApp Business app to reach more people and grow their business. Start your own journey with the WhatsApp Business app&nbsp;<a href="https://business.whatsapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>WhatsApp’s Cloud-based API for businesses and developers</strong></h2>



<p><strong> </strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PIX2-965x630.png?resize=678%2C443&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-116821" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>WhatsApp’s business offering has options available for businesses of all sizes across the world, and as businesses grow, they can progress to using the new secure cloud hosting service provided by Meta which has been created especially for bigger brands. For larger businesses seeking new ways to communicate with their customers faster, conveniently and reliably, WhatsApp’s new Cloud API offers an enterprise-level solution with the ability to pay per conversation with their customers.</p>



<p>The start-up time on this new API has been cut down from months to minutes, enabling businesses and developers to quickly and easily access the WhatsApp business offering. This API, which is built directly on top of WhatsApp, allows businesses and developers to customise their experience and increase the speed at which they can typically respond to their customers.</p>



<p>Businesses can sign-up directly for this service and eliminate costly server expenses via&nbsp;<a href="https://business.whatsapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://business.whatsapp.com/</a>.</p>

<p>June 14, 2022 &#8211; Today WhatsApp has announced the launch of the WhatsAppreneurs campaign, profiling small entrepreneurs from Africa who are using the WhatsApp Business app to grow their business and&nbsp; reach more customers . The campaign will highlight the stories of Small and Medium Business owners in Africa, and help them and others like them learn more about business growth opportunities available with the WhatsApp Business app through a virtual educational webinar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commenting on the launch of the WhatsAppreneurs campaign, Balkissa Ide Siddo, Public Policy Director for Africa said “Across Africa, small and medium business owners are using the WhatsApp Business app&nbsp; to develop their business, showcase their products, close sales, and connect with their customers. The WhatsApp Business app provides a tool to help businesses thrive in their markets, reach more customers, and grow their businesses consistently. We are delighted to be a part of the success stories of small businesses who are so important to communities across Africa.”</p>



<p>As SMB’s represent a sizable percentage of the economic population demonstrating great potential for growth, opportunity creation, and overcoming poverty post-pandemic, there is a need to provide support through digital tools to help them scale. The WhatsAppreneur campaign serves the purpose of providing the resources businesses need to unlock their growth potential and help build a more resilient, inclusive, and empowered society.</p>



<p>In addition to helping businesses grow, the WhatsApp Business app also provides an opportunity for businesses to create a much deeper and stronger relationship with their customers, often starting with real-time 1:1 conversations via chat, unlike transactional phone calls or SMSs. The WhatsApp Business app is free and allows users to create a business catalogue on WhatsApp that can be viewed by users from anywhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SMB owners can download the WhatsApp Business App at <a href="https://business.whatsapp.com/">https://business.whatsapp.com/</a> and start the journey towards growing their business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About WhatsApp</p>



<p>More than 2 billion people in over 180 countries use WhatsApp to stay in touch with friends and family, anytime and anywhere. WhatsApp is free and offers simple, secure, reliable messaging and calling, all over the world.</p>

<p> WhatsApp, has announced the launch of #YouSaid, a campaign to educate people on how to verify information they come across before passing it on, to help reduce the spread of false news in Nigeria.</p>



<p>The campaign offers tips for WhatsApp users to spot false news and take responsibility in minimizing its spread, by encouraging people to think carefully and check authoritative sources before deciding to share any information with their friends and family.</p>



<p>“At WhatsApp, all personal messages are protected with end-to-end encryption because the safety and security of our users and their messages is important to us. ” Akua Gyekye, WhatsApp Public Policy Lead said while commenting on the launch of the campaign. “While we remain committed to creating a safe space for our users to communicate privately, we encourage everyone to verify any information they receive and confirm whether it is true or false before sharing it with other people. Regardless of the person you received the information from, as soon as you share any information, it becomes something people think #YouSaid. Our hope is that this campaign will open up a conversation on the importance of verifying information and thinking carefully about what people read, trust and choose to share” Gyekye added.</p>



<p><strong><em>Here are four easy ways to reduce the spread of false news on WhatsApp</em></strong></p>



<ol type="1"><li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Understand what a ‘Forwarded’ message means:</strong>&nbsp;Any message that has the ‘forwarded’ label (an arrow or double arrow icon) did not start with the person who sent it to you. They will also have received it from someone else before passing it on to you. If you are not sure the information is true, do not forward it to someone else without verifying it.</li></ol>



<p>A double arrow icon and “Forwarded many times” label will be displayed when a message has been forwarded more than five times since it was originally sent and will restrict sharing to just one chat at a time.</p>



<ol type="1" start="2"><li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Always fact check information with other sources:</strong>&nbsp; False news can go viral, and photos, audio recordings, and videos can be edited to mislead you. If you&#8217;re unsure whether a message is true, check trusted news sites to see where the story came from.

<p><strong>09 November 2021</strong> &#8211; Today, Meta announced the launch of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=27600670000&#038;text=Hi&#038;app_absent=0" target="_blank">Facebook Business Coach</a>, an innovative and easily-accessible way for owners of small-and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya and other English speaking countries to learn more about how to grow their business online with Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=27600670000&amp;text=Hi&amp;app_absent=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook Business Coach</a>&nbsp;available on WhatsApp, is a free-to-use, low data cost educational chatbot tool that users can interact with in a simple, conversational and convenient way. SMBs have access to automated, self-paced lessons that teach them how to establish a presence in today’s ever-evolving digital economy.</p>



<p>As a free curriculum platform, it features step-by-step courses and tutorials as well as helpful infographics, videos, and audio clips. Learning material is recommended based on the user’s needs and queries, with an option to navigate the curriculum via the menu. While the WhatsApp bot provides SMBs with an easy way to quickly learn the basics, users can also access more in-depth&nbsp; training and get officially certified with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebookblueprint.com/student/catalog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meta Blueprint</a>&nbsp;courses online.</p>



<p>The content was created to assist business owners with multiple queries –&nbsp;from how to create attention-grabbing business pages on Facebook and Instagram, to how to use Messenger and WhatsApp to communicate effectively with clients.</p>



<p>Nunu Ntshingila, Regional Director Meta Africa, commented:&nbsp;<em>“In today’s social-media-driven environment, information on building your brand on online platforms can be crucial in what sets a small business apart and drives success. At Meta, we’re passionate about empowering SMBs in Africa with the skills they need to succeed online. We know that they are the backbone of the African economy and the drivers for economic growth.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">One of the most long-standing issues which lowers WhatsApp over other social platforms is its inability to carry forward its Android data over to iOS and vice versa. Countless users have experienced data (chat history) loss when switching from Android to iOS. Yet, there has been no proper official feature for such a common issue that plagues the popular platform. However, there seems to be hope as developers working on a new beta update, founded by WABetaInfo have&nbsp;unearthed&nbsp;a feature that will allow users to synch chat.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WA_DECRYPTINGMESSAGES-868x630.png?resize=678%2C492&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-66375" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Chat Sync via WhatsApp Desktop</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As you must be aware, the developers have already been working on making WhatsApp capable of running multiple devices simultaneously. The chat sync feature is part of it. As demonstrated by the source, WhatsApp Desktop was used to test the chat sync feature. However, since this a beta, it’s very likely that WhatsApp will allow mobile devices to be the main device. The desktop settings use Wi-Fi to download the data from the main device and sends it to the second device. Once two accounts will be synced, all connected devices will receive messages. WhatsApp also has an iPad app, so the feature will also work on iPhones and iPads.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A word of caution though. There was no demo about an Android to iOS chat sync. However, it looks likely in the future.</p>
