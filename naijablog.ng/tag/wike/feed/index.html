<p>Nyesom Wike has called on the River State Governor, Sim Fubara no to pull down the ladder he used in climbing.</p>



<p>Wike says this when he received traditional rulers in house house in the state during the weekend.</p>



<p>The former governor reportedly spoke at his residence in Port Harcourt, the state capital while addressing the traditional ruler of Ogbaland, who came to felicitate with him on the occasion of his birthday.</p>



<p>The chiefs and other members of the traditional institution from Ogbaland in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area of the state were led by their traditional ruler, Nwachukwu Nnam.</p>



<p>Wike assured the monarch that he would listen, insisting that he was disposed to peaceful resolution of the crisis.</p>



<p>The minister debunked claims that the political impasse was an ethnic war, insisting that it had no tribal colouration.</p>



<p>He said: “We didn’t vote based on ethnicity…but for the unity of Rivers. We shall never be part of violence but will always support peace.</p>



<p>“There are rules within the political group you emerge. You cannot say that because an Oba has emerged and then an Oba will not follow the rules of the traditional institution.</p>



<p>“No; an Oba will always obey the rules. So also in politics, there are things you must not do and there are things you must do.”</p>

<p>Ex-governor of River State Nyesom Wike has continued to receive backlash over his loghead with his successor, Sim.</p>



<p>Reacting to the ongoing battle between former governor and the current state governor, former presidential aide, Laolu Akande, expressed his disappointment at the immediate past Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike.</p>



<p>Akande, who was the spokesman to former Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, wondered why Wike, now the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, cannot manage his own anointed governor.</p>



<p>“What is happening in Rivers State is very disappointing. Look, a lot of people had deep respect for the FCT Minister …you can easily see that Wike was the kind of guy that got it done and he got the reputation,” Akande said on Channels Television.</p>



<p>“He was called Mr. Project and all that. There’s quite a bit of political regard that you’ve to give to Wike. I think in this country today, after the President, Nyesom Wike is the most prominent politician.</p>



<p>“So, when somebody has attained that level of political relevance, it means you really have to carry yourself with a lot of grace, with a lot of measured management of the expectations around you.</p>



<p>“It is disappointing that the FCT Minister is not managing his own anointed governor and the responsibility is more on him than the governor. Wike is the senior partner in this matter and it is not good for him,” he added</p>

<p>The Rivers State Governor, Siminalayi Fubara, on Wednesday congratulated his predecessor, Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Nyesom Wike, on the latter’s 56th birthday, amid political tension in the state.</p>



<p>In the birthday post shared on Fubara’s X page, the state governor hailed Wike as ‘my oga’, as he also showered prayers on the Federal Capital Territory Minister.</p>



<p>This is coming amid the political tension in the state as Fubara presented the 2024 Appropriation Bill to five members of the state House of Assembly. Twenty-seven lawmakers of the House recently defected from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress. The 27 members, loyal to Wike, were not present at the sitting on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, on Wednesday night, hosted Peoples Democratic Party’s candidates for the State and National Assembly elections in Cross Rivers State.</p>



<p>The delegation which include chairmen of the party in the various local government areas is led by the Cross River Governorship Candidate of the party, Senator Sandy Onor.</p>



<p>In his speech, Onor said, “Today is historic. Wike is a trail blazer for justice and equity. He speaks the truth fearlessly.”</p>



<p>He said the candidates were in Rivers to “thank Wike for being a good friend when Governor Ben Ayade defected to the All Progressives Congress”.</p>



<p>“Wike has defended us and protected us from intimidation. He has made PDP a party to beat in Cross River.</p>



<p>“There is nothing that Wike is asking for that is personal. All he seeks for is justice,” he noted.</p>



<p>Onor also announced that Wike donated 25 brand new buses for the campaigns in Cross River State.</p>

<p>The governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has said that he’s not the one forcing the national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Iyorchia Ayu, to resign.</p>



<p>He said this on Friday during a media chat with some journalists.</p>



<p>When asked about his insistence that Ayu must resign as PDP national chairman, he said, “Nobody forced Ayu to say that if the presidential candidate emerges from the north, he would resign. Nobody forced him. He knew that has been the practice.”</p>



<p>The PDP has been experiencing some crisis in recent times over the chairmanship of the party.</p>

<p>River State governor, Nyesom Wike said he will remain in People Democratic party, PDP.</p>



<p>Reaction from the governor come as PDP Crisis worsen, and Nigerian thought Wike will get angry and dumped the party.</p>



<p>Reacting to the rumour, Wike said he remain in the party, but he will fight them.</p>



<p>His words read:</p>



<p>“One thing I have always told people is, if anybody is thinking, doing anything to think that we will leave PDP, foul. We will do the fight in the party. We are not like them, when in 2014 they walked out from Eagle Square. They’ve forgot. They walked out and joined APC. Is it not correct?</p>



<p>“Did they remain to fight inside the party? But we remained, they ran away. Now, there is a fight in the party, we will not run. We will fight it in this party. Those who run away from fight are weak people. We will not. So, everybody should know this is the state where we are. So that nobody tells you all kind of stories.”</p>

<p>The Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, has blasted his predecessor, Rotimi Amaechi, over his comments at the burial of four-time federal minister, Alabo Tamunotenyim Omubo Graham-Douglas (TOG).</p>



<p>Amaechi at the burial over the weekend knocked Wike for not taking responsibility for Alabo’s burial. He said, “Indeed going by the contributions he made to the state, I was thinking that the state would take responsibility for everything concerning Alabo. You don’t need to be Governor to be recognised.”</p>



<p>Reacting to Amaechi, the Rivers governor said, “It’s unfortunate and I ask him, when Alabo was sick, where were you? This state government committed so much to make sure Alabo survived. I want to challenge anybody. We didn’t spend anything less than N50 million to make sure our elder statesman survived. It is the survival we want. We wanted him to be alive.</p>



<p>“When his late son had an accident and was flown to London, this state government bore the cost. Go and ask people. We don’t need to say all these things but you like to eulogise the dead.”<br></p>
