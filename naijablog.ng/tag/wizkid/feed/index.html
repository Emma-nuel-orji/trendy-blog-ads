<p>Nigerian comedian, basket mouth speak on how he feel when they accused wizkid of being proud.</p>



<p>In his explanation, </p>



<p>“All these talks about Wizkid being proud will always be funny to me. 2014 I had my show in Lagos and I really needed Wizkid to perform and I was willing to pay him anything.</p>



<p>I contacted him and he told not to bother about paying him. He promised to come as a surprise guest &amp; put up a show for free.</p>



<p>3 days to the event, Wizkid called me that he won’t be able to show up coz a very important family emergency had happened. I was really heartbroken but I just had to accept the reality. 35 minutes after that call, Wizkid asked me to contact any Nigerian artiste I will like to book for the event and get back to him with the bills. I quickly contacted Lil Kesh, Kcee, Yemi Alade and Phyno. The bill was about 40 Million Naira and Wizkid cleared it all. Mannn! I thought I was dreaming. Wizkid is not the guy social media keeps trying to make y’all believe he is” ~ Basket Mouth.</p>

<p>Jada Pollock, the manager of singer, Wizkid and mother of his third son, has expressed her excitement at becoming a mum of two.</p>



<p>Pollock, who shared photos of her bare baby bump and son, Zion, on Instagram on Saturday, declared that the next chapter of her life would be better than she could wish for.</p>



<p>She said, &#8220;Here&#8217;s to the very next chapter. I know it&#8217;s about to be better than anything I could have ever wished for. Two beautiful children to brighten my days.</p>



<p>&#8220;Too NEVER make me want to give up. Too make me want to go HARDER and fight harder then I need too. Love deeper than I knew I could and give me even more of a perspective and purpose, then I could have foreseen for life. Just when we thought that we was blessed with one incredible human GOD showed up again and blessed us with another. Feeling so grateful and blessed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Music Base Africa took to it official Facebook page to reawaking what is has been forgetting.</p>



<p>In a post share on it official Facebook page, MBA recall back on how Tiwa Savage Consider Koredo Bello under age, and refused to twerk for him in his Music video few years ago, but never object to Wizkid demand who is also an underage.</p>



<p>Read full gist below</p>



<p>Did You Know<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2753.png" alt="❓" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />Tiwa Savage refused to dance or twerk for Korede Bello in the music video for the song &#8220;Romantic&#8221; coz she considered him a Kid(age wise)<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/203c.png" alt="‼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />6 years ago, under the Canopy of Mavins Records , Korede Bello dropped one of the biggest African love songs ever titled &#8220;Romantic&#8221; featuring Tiwa Savage ! He actually wanted Tiwa and himself to play love bird games in the music video BUT Tiwa Savage objected saying she was 17 years older than him<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Because of this, Korede Bello and Tiwa had to look for their respective partners(vixens) for the video.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, few years later, Tiwa Savage twerked and danced for Wizkid who is 11 years younger than her on several occasions…rumor even circulated that they were dating <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/203c.png" alt="‼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Roy Emmanuel, one of the aides of singer, Wizkid, has slammed the claims of Ahmed, a teenager, who the singer had promised the sum of N10 million and offered to sign him to his Starboy records some years back.</p>



<p>Ahmed in recent videos alleged that the singer didn’t fulfil his promise.</p>



<p>Speaking in Pidgin English, Ahmed said, “Na wetin I dey do (rapping in exchange for cash)to feed my parents. Because of this Wizkid sign me, my father die. And I no see anything. Baba talk say him go sign me. Abeg Baba, I no say you go help my life. Abeg Baba, show me love, no let my life remain like dis.”</p>



<p>In another video shared by blog, Gossipmill, Ahmed knelt down to beg Nigerians to plead with Wizkid.</p>



<p>He said, “If Wizkid really gave me ten million, my life would not still be like this. I would not be going around begging for money on the streets. Please Nigerians, help me beg Wizkid to come and help me.”</p>



<p>Reacting to the claims, Wizkid’s aide, Roy said, “Ahmed is an Ingrate. Wizkid gave him more than 10 million, still put him in one of the best schools. Got them a new apartment, furnished everywhere but he was just busy smoking up and down and doing some gang sh*t. That’s why he got expelled and for his mum, Wizkid gave her huge money to start up a good business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grammy award-winning artist, Wizkid is trending on Twitter and we have David to thank for this.</p>



<p>On the 2nd of October, A Twitter User identified as David Onyemaizu incurred the wrath of Wizkid’s Fanbase after he critically analyzed Wizkid’s music.</p>



<p>According to David, Wizkid won’t be relevant in about 20 years because of the music he churns out. He opines that Wizkid’s music gets stale after a year or two, unlike Michael Jackson’s and Brymo’s which are perfect examples of timeless music.</p>



<p>David admitted that Wizkid is good, but Brymo is a better singer, songwriter, and performer. He added that 300 years from now, Burna Boy, Brymo, and Davido will be remembered, but not Wizkid. According to him, parents will make reference to Burna’s Grammy, theEndSars protest, and even sing the lyrics of FEM, but no one will remember Wizkid’s Joro.</p>



<p>David confessed that he was a big fan of Wizkid, but the toxicity from his fanbase made him loathe Wizkid.</p>
