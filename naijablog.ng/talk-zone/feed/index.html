<p>PDP Chieftains Push for Peter Obi’s Return, Reject Northern Candidate in 2027</p>



<p>The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has initiated reconciliation efforts to bring back its former members, including Labour Party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi.</p>



<p>The PDP stalwarts said thoughts of a northerner vying for the party’s presidential ticket before 2031 should be abandoned. The announcement followed a meeting held at Chief Bode George’s office in Lagos on Monday, attended by party leaders, officers, and a group of national mobilisers led by Iteh Ubon.</p>

<p>He said: </p>



<p>Father Mbaka criticised former President Jonathan and he was not punished or banished. Father Mbaka criticised General Buhari and he was not punished or banished. So, why should Father Mbaka be punished and banished after criticising Peter Obi? I may be wrong, but it just seems that what Father Mbaka said about a then incumbent President Jonathan was much worse than what he said about Obi. Father Mbaka lied. He claimed former President Jonathan wanted to kill him (please research it). What is so unique about what Father Mbaka said Obi that warrants his current travails? Can someone please explain the logic behind this without insulting anyone?</p>

<p>Virginity is a pride of woman they says.</p>



<p>Every man want to marry a virgin, while every parents, mother and father want there daughter married out as a virgin.</p>



<p>Also we know woman reproductive system has expiring period.</p>



<p>The expiring period of women reproductive system is when she reaches her menopause.</p>



<p>At these period, the woman can&#8217;t give birth to children anymore.</p>



<p>Most women menopause start at the age of 45 years.</p>



<p>Some begins their menopause at earlier age, which is within 40 years of age, while some at 50 years, they are still seeing their menstruation.</p>



<p>Every woman at 40 years of age, is close to her menopause, that means be it virgin or not when she 40 years old, she is close to her menopause</p>



<p>At this age, if woman, your sister, daughter is still a virgin at 40 years, are going to commend her or see it as cause? </p>
