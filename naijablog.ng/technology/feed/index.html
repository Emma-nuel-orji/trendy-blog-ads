										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In clear recognition of the critical role Nigeria is playing on the global telecom stage, the country was re-elected earlier today as a Council member of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the United Nations specialised agency that oversees global telecommunication operations. Nigeria will serve on the Council again from 2023-2026.</p>



<p>The election of Nigeria and other countries, on Monday, October 3, 2022, into different regional groups that constitute ITU Council, was the highpoint of the Plenipotentiary Conference 2022 (PP-22) ongoing in Bucharest, the capital city of the Republic of Romania.</p>



<p>The Nigerian delegation was successfully led to the global event by the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami. Other members of the delegation include Chairman, Board of Commissioners of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Adeolu Akande, and the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta.</p>



<p>At the conference which started on September 26, 2022 and scheduled to end on October 14, 2022, member states at the event voted on the composition of the next ITU Council and the 12 representatives to serve on the Radio Regulations Board (RRB) for the next four years.</p>



<p>The 21st Plenipotentiary Conference of the Council, also saw the election by member states, of Doreen Bogdan-Martin of the United States of America as the organisation’s next Secretary-General.</p>



<p>Like Nigeria and the countries elected into the Council, Bogdan-Martin, as the first woman to lead ITU in its 157-year history, will begin her four-year term from January 2023, when Houlin Zhao would have completed his second final term of four years in office as ITU Secretary General.</p>



<p>The seats in ITU Council are divided into five regions, A to E. Nigeria was elected into the ITU Council Region D for Africa, which has 13 seats. Other 12 countries elected alongside Nigeria are Algeria, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Tunisia, and Uganda.</p>



<p>Elections of member states also took place into the Region A for The Americas (nine seats); Region B for Western Europe (eight seats); Region C for Eastern Europe &amp; Northern Asia (five seats); and Region E, for Asia and Australasia with 13 seats as Africa.</p>



<p>Commenting on Nigeria’s re-election as ITU Council member, the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Prof. Umar Danbatta, thanked the ITU member states for the confidence it has in Nigeria, expressed by the re-elected into the ITU Council, in which the country has been playing critical role over the years.</p>



<p>“The re-election of Nigeria as a member of ITU Council for the next four years, again points to the globally-recognised leadership role Nigeria is playing in Africa and at the level of ITU Council in the area of telecommunications policy formulation and technical regulations development to drive ITU’s mission and vision,” the EVC said.</p>



<p>The ITU, originally established in 1865 as the International Telegraph Union and became a United Nations specialised agency in 1947, was set up to coordinate telecommunications operations and services throughout the world. It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>



<p>Nigeria became a member of ITU on November 4, 1961. The USA joined on July 1, 1908; United Kingdom, February 24, 1871, and UAE on June 27, 1972.</p>



<p>The ITU is governed by the Plenipotentiary Conference and the Administrative Council. The Plenipotentiary Conference is the supreme organ of the Union. It is the decision-making body which determines the direction of the Union and its activities.</p>



<p>The Council, on the other hand, acts as the Union’s governing body in the interval between Plenipotentiary Conferences. Its role is to consider broad telecommunication policy issues to ensure that the Union&#8217;s activities, policies, and strategies fully respond to today&#8217;s dynamic, rapidly changing telecommunications environment.</p>



<p>ITU Council also prepares a report on the policy and strategic planning of the ITU, and it is responsible for ensuring the smooth day-to-day running of the Union, coordinating work programmes, approving budgets, and controlling finances and expenditure.</p>



<p>The Council also takes all steps to facilitate the implementation of the provisions of the ITU Constitution, the ITU Convention, the Administrative Regulations (International Telecommunications Regulations, and Radio Regulations), the decisions of Plenipotentiary Conferences, and where appropriate, the decisions of other conferences and meetings of the Union.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We’ve helped more than a billion people connect with loved ones in a trusted space on Messenger, and we know that people want to engage in real time with larger communities over shared interests. Today,<a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/pfbid023w43bp4o5EHhDzfya42n6P8HPTk21J8uokbUsASVvYhD6M81PbUUZpCLQWhqRokLl"> Mark Zuckerberg announced</a> we’ll begin testing the ability for people to start Community Chats in Messenger in the coming weeks, allowing people to create a Facebook Group, start chats and audio channels, and invite others to join their new group all within the app. We’ll also be expanding Community Chats to even more Facebook Groups.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screenshot_20220916-102907-373x630.jpg?resize=373%2C630&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-124745" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Community Chats?</h2>



<p>Community Chats let people connect more deeply with communities in real time around the topics they care about in multiple formats, including text, audio and video. The experience seamlessly blends Messenger and Facebook Groups to allow people to connect when, where and how they want. Admins can now start a conversation about a topic and get in-the-moment responses instead of waiting for people to comment on a post. And, rather than navigating multiple topics in a single Messenger group chat, the person who creates the Community Chat can organize chats into categories so group members can easily find what’s most interesting to them. For example, a band’s fan group could have a “Breaking News” category with chats dedicated to new album drops, tour dates and group activities.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screenshot_20220916-102917-650x630.jpg?resize=650%2C630&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-124746" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How It Works</h2>



<p>Check out how Vanessa Yaeger, admin of the <a href="https://web.facebook.com/groups/660162784037641/?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr">Women Who Surf </a>Facebook Group, uses Community Chats to bring her members together in real time for a spontaneous IRL meetup.</p>



<p>Admins can choose from several options to help their communities connect. They can start a chat for group members around a specific topic, an event chat for an outing or meetup, a view-only broadcast chat for admins to announce group-wide updates and an admin-only chat to collaborate with admins and moderators. Admins can also create audio channels so group members can share live commentary or receive real-time support. Participants also have the option to enable video once they’re in the audio channel. For example, the admin of a Facebook Group for chemistry students could create audio channels for study groups during finals season, and participants can turn on video for live tutoring. Community Chats are only accessible to members of a group. To learn more about how to use Community Chats, check out the <a href="https://web.facebook.com/community/whats-new/using-community-chats-in-your-group/?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr">Facebook Community Blog</a>.<br /></p>



<p>Given the more public nature of Community Chats, we’ve developed a robust suite of tools to help admins easily manage both chat and audio experiences. This includes moderation capabilities like blocking, muting or suspending group members, and removing members or messages, as well as Admin Assist, which allows admins to set custom criteria that will automatically suspend users, remove reported messages, and stop messages from ineligible authors or containing violating content from being sent. Members of Community Chats can also report messages to group admins or Meta, block users or leave a chat at any time.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s Next</h2>



<p>We’re committed to building messaging experiences that help people connect with their communities, friends and families. As Community Chats rolls out to more people and groups around the world, we’ll continue exploring new features and capabilities to make it easier to connect with one another.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Easy to send and fun to listen to, voice messages have become a go-to for many when sharing funny anecdotes or heartfelt messages with friends and family. With 7 billion voice messages sent on WhatsApp every day, they are a popular way of sharing in-the-moment updates, with the added expressiveness that comes with speech. Voice messages are protected by end-to-end encryption, to keep your personal messages secure at all times.</p>



<p>But as quick as it is to swipe and send a voice message, they should be shared with thought. Receiving long rambles that could take ten minutes to listen to, or playing a message from a parent out loud on public transport is neither fun nor convenient. And what about the politics of replying? Must you respond to a voice message with one of your own?</p>



<p>To help navigate voice message etiquette, WhatsApp has shared tops tips on how to voice message like a pro:</p>



<ol type="1"><li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Don’t record a podcast:</strong>&nbsp;While everyone has a different opinion on the ideal length of a voice message, try keeping them to 1 or 2 minutes. If it’s too long to type but too short for a call, you’ve found the voice message sweet spot. And if you receive a voice message that is unbearably long, you can play it at 1.5x or 2x speeds to listen to it faster.</li></ol>



<ol type="1" start="2"><li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Break it up:&nbsp;</strong>If you really can’t shorten your message, consider breaking it up into shorter ones and sending them separately. Your recipient can choose to binge-listen in one sitting or squeeze them in around their schedule.</li></ol>



<ol type="1" start="3"><li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Respect others:</strong>&nbsp;Be aware of your surroundings when listening to a voice message. Loud playback can be annoying for those around you, but the message may also contain private information. Keep the volume down or use headphones in quiet, crowded places like train carriages.</li></ol>



<ol type="1" start="4"><li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Cut the questions:&nbsp;</strong>Be mindful of how many questions you ask in a single voice note so your recipient doesn’t forget half of them when trying to reply.</li></ol>



<ol type="1" start="5"><li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Return the favour:</strong>&nbsp;If you receive a voice message, try sending one back. A two-way voice conversation is much better than a one-sided rant.</li></ol>



<ol type="1" start="6"><li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Be timely:&nbsp;</strong>Remember to reply to voice messages in a timely manner. If you’re really tight for time, you can send a voice message hands-free while multi-tasking. Simply hold down the microphone icon and swipe up to lock your recording in place. When finished, tap to send.</li></ol>



<p><strong><em>According to WhatsApp, “</em></strong><em>Technology has helped us communicate in an informal, relaxed manner with family and friends, and voice messages over WhatsApp are a popular way to share a funny anecdote, or a heartfelt message &#8211; particularly as they’re protected by end-to-end encryption. That said, at times we can forget the importance of etiquette in digital situations, and there are no official rules to guide us. I’m excited to share some etiquette tips, to help you and the people you’re sharing them with get the best from voice messaging”.</em></p>

<p>The Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ali Ibrahim (Pantami), is very excited to hear of the remarkable contribution of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector to Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the second quarter of 2022 (Q2 2022). The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) stated this in the ‘Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product Report’ for Q2 2022, released on the 26th of August, 2022.</p>



<p>The Digital Economy sector under Professor Pantami has continued its trend of playing a key part in the growth on Nigeria’s economy. The Report by the NBS indicated that the ICT sector contributed 18.44% to the total real GDP in Q2 2022. This is the highest contribution of ICT to the GDP and is truly unprecedented and marks the third time that the sector has achieved an unprecedented contribution to Nigeria’s GDP during the tenure of the Honourable Minister- in Q1 2020, Q2 2021 and now Q2 2022.</p>



<p>The oil sector contributed 6.33% to the total real GDP in Q2 2022, which was lower than the contribution in Q2 &#8216;2021 and Q1 &#8216;2022, where it contributed 7.42% and 6.63% respectively. The non-oil sector&#8217;s contribution grew by 4.77% in real terms, resulting in a 93.67% contribution to the nation’s GDP in the Q2 &#8216;2022, higher than Q2 &#8216;2021 and Q2 &#8216;2022, where it contributed 92.58% and 93.37% respectively.</p>



<p>The Honorable Minister notes that the growing contribution of the ICT sector to the GDP is as a result of the commitment of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR to the development of the digital economy. The diligent implementation of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) for a Digital Nigeria, stakeholder engagement and creation of an enabling environment have all played an important role in this achievement.</p>



<p>The support of President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, has contributed immensely to the impressive developments in the sector. The unprecedented contribution of ICT to Nigeria’s GDP can also be attributed to the dynamic and results-oriented leadership of the sector. The GDP Report has shown how critical the ICT sector is to the growth of our country’s digital economy and, by extension, the general economy.</p>



<p>The Honourable Minister congratulates all stakeholders in the digital economy ecosystem for this cheering news. He also renews his call to all sectors to take advantage of the Federal Government’s new focus on the digital economy to enable and improve their processes through the use of ICTs. This would enhance the output of all the sectors of the economy and boost Nigeria’s GDP.</p>



<p>Dr Femi Adeluyi<br />Technical Assistant (Research and Development) to theHonourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy<br />27th August 2022</p>

<p>22 August 2022: Today, Meta announced that applications for the AR/VR Africa Metathon in partnership with Imisi 3D and BlackRhino VR are now open. The AR/VR Africa Metathon is a series of programmes and activations under the Meta global XR fund aimed at supporting African XR talents to build innovative solutions that demonstrate various use cases of the metaverse in Africa.</p>



<p>The AR/VR Metathon will feature three major components including a training program, an Africa-wide hackathon which will take place&nbsp; across 16 countries in Africa physically and open to everyone virtually, followed by an intensive bootcamp to further develop solutions. These components will run from Mid-August – April 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Phil Oduor, Policy Programs Lead for Africa at Meta, “The AR/VR Africa Metathon is an opportunity to demonstrate how artificial intelligence, augmented reality and virtual reality technologies that have been around for decades, are core to the future of the metaverse and what Africans are building in the industry.” Oduor further adds, “The XR Programs and Research Fund is a two-year $50 million investment into programs and external research focused on building the metaverse responsibly. Through this fund, we are collaborating with industry partners, civil rights groups, governments, nonprofits and academic institutions to determine how to build these technologies responsibly. This is why we have partnered with Imisi 3D and BlackRhino VR, an extended reality ecosystem developer&nbsp; and a virtual reality production company, who represent Africa’s creative and innovative landscape, to launch this program to support African XR talent who are building innovative solutions that demonstrate the various aspects of the metaverse in Africa.”</p>



<p>Judith Okonkwo, Founder Imisi 3D &amp; AR/VR Africa said, “Six&nbsp;years after our first hackathon, and following subsequent events in over 28 countries across the continent, we are especially thrilled to be partnering with Meta and BlackRhino VR for the 2022 edition. This year’s AR/VR Africa Metathon brings together our AR/VR Africa pre-hackathon training, hackathon, and bootcamp in one programme. Working with partners in 16 countries, it is our biggest and most ambitious event yet&nbsp; providing even greater access for XR. In addition to physical events in these countries, we welcome participants across the continent who will be able to learn and hack virtually. At this time of intense global interest in the Metaverse, our mission remains the same &#8211; increasing access to XR resources on the continent, accelerating XR talent, showcasing African XR solutions and creating pathways for careers and industry.”</p>



<p>&#8220;We are honored and elated to have partnered with Meta and Imis 3D on this promising project. The Metathon will encourage exploration and discovery among young African creative technologists who will have the opportunity to develop Afrocentric XR use cases that will tackle some of the unique challenges they are facing in our continent. This type of collaboration is what Africa needs to highlight the potential of new and untapped socioeconomic opportunities created by XR Technologies&#8221; commented Brian Afande, Co-founder and Managing Director, BlackRhino VR.</p>



<p>All developers, programmers, UI/UX designers, artists, animators, storytellers, professionals and students interested in participating in the 12 weeks training can register through this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://form.typeform.com/to/qHCfq759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://form.typeform.com/to/qHCfq759</a>&nbsp;for the opportunity to share their innovative work in AR/VR</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You really won&#8217;t have to wait too long to finish your project or deliver jobs to your clients again thanks to the best laptops for video editing. The question is, which laptop models are the greatest for your video editing needs, given the wide range of options available?</p>
<p>However, we have compiled a list of options that includes laptops with strong processors, sufficient RAM, and high-quality screens. The finest laptops for video editing must have these qualities, but you should be aware that they are not inexpensive if you want the high performance you require.</p>
<p>Making use of high-resolution video requires a lot of memory and processing power, so ensure sure your computer is capable of handling it. Even though it can be enticing to choose one of the best budget laptops. stead, you&#8217;ll probably find that this just won&#8217;t be able to adequately suit your needs &#8211; and you&#8217;ll just find yourself wishing you&#8217;d chosen one of these superior models anyway.</p>
<p>The best laptops for video editing are typically larger than average due to their enormous, gorgeous screens and ample memory. This shouldn&#8217;t be a problem for you if your work is often done in one location. But if you&#8217;re always on the run, you might want to choose a smaller laptop.</p>
<h2>How To Pick The Best Laptops For Video Editing</h2>
<p>What characteristics distinguish a good laptop for video editing? You must first obtain long-lasting battery power. Video editing can be demanding, especially when working with ultra-high-resolution footage, so you&#8217;ll need a laptop with enough RAM (at least 8GB, though 16GB is advisable).</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also need a modern processor, such as one from Intel or AMD, or, if you&#8217;re looking for a MacBook, Apple&#8217;s M1 chip, which has proven to be an excellent piece of hardware for video editing.</p>
<p>Because video files can be quite large, video editors will also require a laptop with plenty of fast SSD storage. Even if you use external storage, you&#8217;ll want something that allows you to quickly open files or move them between the laptop and a backup drive, a perfect example is the following list of laptops.</p>
<p>Read Also: <a href="https://androidweb24.com/top-5-best-laptops-for-programming/">Top 5 Best Laptops For Programming</a></p>
<h2>1. Dell XPS 15</h2>
<p>The Dell XPS 15 features an SD card port, up to an Intel Core i9 processor, a solid 64GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of solid-state storage, making it the perfect device for consuming gigabytes of 4K entertainment. Although its Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti graphics card won&#8217;t match up to some of the top-tier competition, you can replace it with an external, desktop GPU thanks to Thunderbolt 4 connectivity for more demanding projects, and for fast edits on the fly, it&#8217;ll be more than capable.</p>
<h2>2. Acer ConceptD 7</h2>
<p>The Acer Concept range is a collection of laptops and desktops that have been tailored for designers and editors if you have a lot of money to spend. The ConceptD 7-series laptop, in particular, boasts gaming laptop power without any garnish casing or eye-catching RGB lighting and equally pass for one of the best laptops for video editing. Additionally, it&#8217;s silent, keeping cool without having noisy fans whirling or roaring.</p>
<p>The Acer ConceptD 7&#8217;s 4K UHD display, which is excellent for color grading and completely covers the Adobe RGB gamut, is a remarkable feat that few other monitor screens can equal. You can depend on the display for work that requires color accuracy because it is Pantone validated and has a Delta E 2 color accuracy.</p>
<p>Featuring the most recent Intel hexa-core i7 internals, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card, and higher. The recent Intel hexa-core i7 internals, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card, and up to 32GB RAM should make quick work of processing Full HD or 4K footage on Acer&#8217;s ConceptD.</p>

<h2>Mac Book Pro M1 (16-inches)</h2>
<p>Our best pick for video editing is the slightly older but still fantastic 16-inch MacBook Pro until we&#8217;ve had the newest 2022 13-inch MacBook Pro with its M2 technology in for review. Despite having this much power, the M1 chip architecture&#8217;s exceptional efficiency and a huge 100-watt-hour battery allow for a remarkable 21 hours of battery life.</p>
<p>If you equip a device with Apple&#8217;s M1 Max CPU, which comes with up to 64GB of RAM, it will easily handle whatever you can throw at it. Additionally, you get a screen size of 16 inches, which is notably more pleasant for extended editing sessions than a panel of 13 inches. This amazing Liquid Retina XDR display can display a high DCI-P3 color space coverage for precise video editing and sports an unbelievable 1,600-nit peak brightness, bringing HDR content to life.</p>
<p>No matter how you configure one, the 2021 16-inch MacBook Pro is not cheap, but you are spending your money on one of the most cutting-edge laptops available today. A less expensive option is the MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021).</p>
<h2>4. Asus ROG Zephyrus G15</h2>
<p>Want a capable laptop for editing videos but don&#8217;t want to go the MacBook route? If you want a laptop computer with unrelenting computing power, this is it, in our opinion. There won&#8217;t be anything this beast can&#8217;t handle with its powerful octa-core AMD Ryzen 7 or Ryzen 9 processors and staggering 48GB of RAM.</p>
<p>You also have an option of Nvidia&#8217;s super-powerful GeForce RTX 30-series graphics cards, which are specifically made with gaming in mind. The additional video acceleration is not only excellent for gaming but also very useful for GPU-accelerated video encoding.</p>
<p>A 15.6-inch WQHD (2560 x 1440) IPS screen completes the package. Even though it isn&#8217;t in 4K, it nonetheless boasts 100 percent coverage of the difficult DCI-P3 video color space. A 15.6-inch WQHD (2560 x 1440) IPS screen completes the package. Okay, so it&#8217;s not in 4K, but it does support Dolby Vision HDR and has a whoppingly outstanding 100% coverage of the difficult DCI-P3 video color space.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that there is just a microSD memory card slot available, and that the USB ports are USB 3.2 Gen 2 rather than the newest USB 4.0. However, these are only minor gripes with a machine that can edit videos extremely effectively.</p>
<h2>5. Envy 17</h2>
<p>The Envy 17 comes in a variety of spec configurations, but we believe the &#8217;17-ch0020na&#8217; version is best for serious video editing and is reasonably priced given the amount of power it provides. The HP Envy 17 with its larger than average 17-inch screen gives you appreciably more display real estate for video previews and timelines, as well as multitasking.</p>
<p>The screen itself is not, by any means, just quantity above quality. For a laptop display, the IPS LCD panel&#8217;s 4K (3840 x 2160) resolution, 400-nit maximum brightness, and ability to display the entirety of the Adobe RGB color space are impressive accomplishments. A full-size keyboard can fit in front of the larger screen, and you even have an actual SD card reader built in, which is extremely uncommon in modern laptops.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Welcome to the end of the review. Remember that before selecting the best laptops for video editing, take time to select a PC with broad screen, battery life, storage capacity and processing speed. This would help any novice and professional video editor to deliver the best visual content possible.</p>

<p>Nigeria’s broadband usage has continued on the rise, moving up from 40.9% in February 2022 to 44.5% in July 2022, a figure considered hopeful for achieving the national broadband target of 70% in 2025.</p>



<p>Executive Vice Chairman of the Commission, Prof. Umar Danbatta, who disclosed this yesterday at the beginning of a three-day public inquiry on five telecom regulations and guidelines which began in Abuja, said emerging technologies and advancements in the sector, demand that the Commission is prepared to match these developments with appropriate regulations and guidelines.</p>



<p>“With the technological advancements anticipated in the coming years, it is expected that there will be a proliferation of devices in the industry. It is, therefore, essential for the Commission to ensure that the right regulatory frameworks can accommodate such eventualities”, he said.</p>



<p>At the event which was attended by all members of the Board of Commissioners, led by its Chairman, Prof. Adeolu Akande, the Commission’s CEO said the public inquiry which covered five areas of existing regulations, are aimed at achieving operational efficiency and operational excellence. He listed the regulatory instruments under review at the public inquiry to include: Type Approval Regulations, Guidelines on Short Code Operation in Nigeria, Guidelines on Technical Specifications for the Deployment of Communications Infrastructure, Guidelines on Advertisements and Promotions, as well as Consumer Code of Practice Regulations.</p>



<p>He said the focus areas were already articulated in some important documents guiding the operations of the Commission, which include the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP) 2020 – 2025, the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) 2020 – 2030, NCC’s Strategic Management Plan (SMP) 2020-2024, and its Strategic Vision Implementation Plan (SVIP) 2021–2025, which are being implemented towards achieving its mandate.</p>



<p>While stating that these strides are the results of the Commission’s regulatory efficiency and focused implementation of policies and strategies of the Federal Government of Nigeria, Danbatta said the public inquiry is in tandem with the Commission’s strategy of consulting stakeholders in all its regulatory interventions.</p>



<p>The EVC further stated that the amendment of these regulatory instruments were to reflect current realities, one of which is the anticipated deployment of the Fifth Generation (5G) technology, and management of short codes in Nigeria, including the Toll-Free Emergency Code 112.</p>



<p>Earlier, Head, Telecoms Laws and Regulations at NCC, Helen Obi, had stated that public inquiry allows the Commission to incorporate the comments and suggestions of industry stakeholders, in the development of its regulatory instruments.</p>



<p>She said the process ensures that the Commission’s regulatory instruments are in line with the current realities in the industry as it had done with some regulatory frameworks and guidelines in 2021.</p>
