<p>Singer Portable’s alleged side chick, Elizabeth Adegoke, has accused him of abandoning her after impregnating her.</p>



<p>Speaking in a chat with Instablog9ja, she said: “He came for a show at a club in Egbeda on December 18, 2021. I was at the show with a friend when he saw me and asked someone to call me. We began dating afterwards and we were together until about three months ago when he literally abandoned me.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://naijablog.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/instablog9ja_720p_20231216_032547.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Trouble started after I got pregnant and told him. He didn’t show concern or support me in any way. He told me to sponsor the pregnancy myself that I will enjoy after I birth the child.</p>



<p>When I learned about his third baby mama, Honey Berry’s pregnancy and how he was showing her love and affection, I decided to terminate mine at four months.</p>



<p>However, I had some complications, which has left me with severe pains ever since.</p>



<p>I recently went to the hospital to do a scan and they said my womb has issues. I decided not to tell him not to spoil his home but he stared ignoring me. He doesn’t even want to see me. I sent him messages but he didn’t reply any of them.</p>



<p>I’m even trying to chat him up just for him to help me but he turned me down. I see him helping different people but he don’t even care about me. Nigerians should please come to my aid, I am dying in pains.“</p>

<p>A trending video has shown the former deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Emeka Ihedioha, saying that Nigeria’s presidency will rotate to the South-East, after the administration of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, if he wins next year’s election.<br><br>Ihedioha in this video said that Nigeria cannot afford to make mistakes in the 2023 election and that there are two parties in the election, the PDP and the All Progressives Congress.</p>



<p>He said, “Let me tell you, after Atiku Abubakar, the next president of Nigeria will come from the South-East of Nigeria. That is the gospel in Accra. You must win in Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi, Gombe, Borno, Yobe, Adamawa etc to become the president of Nigeria.</p>



<p>“There is what we call passion and there’s what we call emotion. They are two different things for people who went to school like me. Emotions don’t win elections. You must be realistic to win elections. You must plan to win election and that is where I belong. I want to tell you, I have the key to the direction of where Ibo should go.”</p>
